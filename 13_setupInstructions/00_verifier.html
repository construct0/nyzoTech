<h1>Verifier</h1>

<p>
    The following instructions are for an Ubuntu Linux system, but the verifier will also run on Windows, Mac OS, and
    other Linux distributions.
</p>

<p>
    Begin the installation by updating <span class="code">apt</span>.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo apt update
</p>

<p>
    Next, install <span class="code">haveged</span>. This is a program that provides entropy for cryptographically
    secure random-number generators. The <span class="code">Verifier</span> class loads its private seed in a static
    block, and lack of sufficient entropy on a system can cause the application to block indefinitely when trying to
    generate a new private seed for the verifier. The key is used to sign both messages and blocks produced by the
    verifier.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo apt install haveged -y
</p>

<p>
    Install the Java development kit (JDK). JDK 8 is preferred for Nyzo.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk -y
</p>

<p>
    Install <span class="code">supervisor</span>. This is used to manage the verifier as a background process.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo apt install supervisor -y
</p>

<p>
    Clone the Nyzo verifier repository.
</p>

<p class="command">
    git clone https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier.git
</p>

<p>
    Change to the new <span class="filename">nyzoVerifier</span> directory and build the code.
</p>

<p class="command">
    cd nyzoVerifier && ./gradlew build
</p>

<p>
    Make the Nyzo data root directory.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/nyzo/production
</p>

<p>
    Copy the trusted entry points file to the data root directory.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo cp trusted_entry_points /var/lib/nyzo/production
</p>

<p>
    Create the <span class="code">supervisor</span> configuration file. The first command makes the script executable.
    The second command runs the script to generate the file. The third command copies the file to the
    <span class="code">supervisor</span> configuration directory.
</p>

<p class="command">
    chmod +x nyzoVerifier.sh && ./nyzoVerifier.sh && sudo cp nyzoVerifier.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/
</p>

<p>
    If you want to give your verifier a nickname, run the following command. Replace
    <span class="code">VERIFIER_NICKNAME</span> (but leave the quotes) with the name you choose for your verifier:
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo bash -c 'echo "VERIFIER_NICKNAME" > /var/lib/nyzo/production/nickname'
</p>

<p class="italic">
    This next step is not necessary for a new verifier. Only do it if you have a seed from an old verifier that you want
    to reuse. If you skip this step, a seed will be generated for you using a cryptographically secure random-number
    generator the first time the verifier starts. <span class="emphasis">The system is not designed for multiple
    verifiers to run with the same private key. If you do run multiple verifiers with the same private key, they will
    only be able to hold one space in the cycle, and your total earnings will be no more than if you were running only
    one verifier.</span> If you were running a verifier previously and want to reuse the private key from it, run the
    following command. Replace <span class="code">PRIVATE_KEY</span> (but leave the quotes) with your old key value (a
    64-character hexadecimal string, with or without dashes):
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo bash -c 'echo "PRIVATE_KEY" > /var/lib/nyzo/production/verifier_private_seed'
</p>

<p>
    To start the Nyzo verifier, reload supervisor.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo supervisorctl reload
</p>

<p>
    You may now see the private key that was generated for your verifier. You need to use this to access the tokens you
    will earn on your verifier. <span class="emphasis">Keep a copy of this somewhere safe, and do not share it with
    anyone.</span> To see the key, run:
</p>

<p class="command">
    more /var/lib/nyzo/production/verifier_private_seed
</p>
