<h1>Relay server</h1>

<p>
    The relay server is a run mode provided by the Nyzo verifier codebase. The following instructions are for an
    Ubuntu Linux system, but the server will also run on Windows, Mac OS, and other Linux distributions.
</p>

<p>
    Ensure that your server has port 80 open to all IP addresses to which you want to permit access. Begin the
    installation by updating <span class="code">apt</span>.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo apt update
</p>

<p>
    Next, install <span class="code">haveged</span>. This is a program that provides entropy for cryptographically
    secure random-number generators. It is not necessary for the core tasks of the relay server, but the
    <span class="code">Verifier</span> class loads its private seed in a static block, and lack of sufficient entropy on
    a system can cause the application to block indefinitely when trying to generate a new private seed for the
    verifier.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo apt install haveged -y
</p>

<p>
    Install the Java development kit (JDK). JDK 8 is preferred for Nyzo.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk -y
</p>

<p>
    Install <span class="code">supervisor</span>. This is used to manage the server Java process.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo apt install supervisor -y
</p>

<p>
    Clone the Nyzo verifier repository.
</p>

<p class="command">
    git clone https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier.git
</p>

<p>
    Change to the new <span class="filename">nyzoVerifier</span> directory and build the code.
</p>

<p class="command">
    cd nyzoVerifier && ./gradlew build
</p>

<p>
    Make the Nyzo data root directory.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/nyzo/production
</p>

<p>
    Create the <span class="code">supervisor</span> configuration file. The first command makes the script executable.
    The second command runs the script to generate the file. The third command copies the file to the
    <span class="code">supervisor</span> configuration directory.
</p>

<p class="command">
    chmod +x nyzo<wbr>Relay<wbr>Server.<wbr>sh && ./nyzo<wbr>Relay<wbr>Server.sh && sudo cp nyzo<wbr>Relay<wbr>
    Server.<wbr>conf /etc/<wbr>supervisor/<wbr>conf.d/
</p>

<p>
    Create the <span class="filename">/var/<wbr>lib/<wbr>nyzo/<wbr>production/<wbr>relay_<wbr>endpoints</span> file.
    On <a href="https://relay0.nyzo.co">https://relay0.<wbr>nyzo.co</a>, the file is similar to the following. For
    endpoints echoed from other URLs, the third parameter is the refresh interval in milliseconds.
</p>

<p class="code-block">
    https://<wbr>nyzo.co/<wbr>cycle<wbr>Update<wbr>Private,<wbr>/cycle<wbr>Update,<wbr>5000<br>

    file://<wbr>var/<wbr>lib/<wbr>nyzo/<wbr>production/<wbr>web/<wbr>graffiti.<wbr>json,<wbr>/graffiti.json
</p>

<p>
    Start the relay server.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo supervisorctl reload
</p>

<p>
    You should now be able to view your relay server in a web browser. If you cannot load pages, check the firewall to
    ensure port 80 is open. Also, refer to <span class="filename">/var/log/nyzo-relay-server.log</span>.
</p>

<p>
    If you want to enable SSL on your relay server, ensure port 443 is open and follow the
    <a href="webListenerHttps">Web listener HTTPS</a> instructions.
