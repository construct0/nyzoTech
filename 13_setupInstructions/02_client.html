<h1>Client</h1>

<p>
    The Nyzo client is a run mode provided by the Nyzo verifier codebase. The following instructions are for an Ubuntu
    Linux system, but the client will also run on Windows, Mac OS, and other Linux distributions.
</p>

<p>
    If you want to activate web and/or API endpoints, ensure that your server has the proper port open to all IP
    addresses to which you want to permit access. The default port is <span class="code">80</span>, but other ports can
    be used, as is explained later in these instructions.
</p>

<p>
    Begin the installation by updating <span class="code">apt</span>.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo apt update
</p>

<p>
    Next, install <span class="code">haveged</span>. This is a program that provides entropy for cryptographically
    secure random-number generators. The <span class="code">Verifier</span> class loads its private seed in a static
    block, and lack of sufficient entropy on a system can cause the application to block indefinitely when trying to
    generate a new private seed for the verifier. The verifier's key is used to sign all Nyzo messages originating from
    the client.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo apt install haveged -y
</p>

<p>
    Install the Java development kit (JDK). JDK 8 is preferred for Nyzo.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk -y
</p>

<p>
    If you want to run the client as a background process, install <span class="code">supervisor</span>. If you only
    want to run the client on demand, this step can be skipped.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo apt install supervisor -y
</p>

<p>
    Clone the Nyzo verifier repository.
</p>

<p class="command">
    git clone https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier.git
</p>

<p>
    Change to the new <span class="filename">nyzoVerifier</span> directory and build the code.
</p>

<p class="command">
    cd nyzoVerifier && ./gradlew build
</p>

<p>
    Make the Nyzo data root directory.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/nyzo/production
</p>

<p>
    Copy the trusted entry points file to the data root directory.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo cp trusted_entry_points /var/lib/nyzo/production
</p>

<p>
    If you want to run the client as a long-running background process, create the <span class="code">supervisor</span>
    configuration file. The first command makes the script executable. The second command runs the script to generate
    the file. The third command copies the file to the <span class="code">supervisor</span> configuration directory. If
    you only want to run the client on demand, this step can be skipped.
</p>

<p class="command">
    chmod +x nyzoClient.sh && ./nyzoClient.sh && sudo cp nyzoClient.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/
</p>

<p>
    If you want to use the web listener and you want to use a port other than <span class="code">80</span>, add the
    appropriate line to <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/preferences</span>. For example, if you wanted
    to use port 8080 for all run modes, you would add this line:
</p>

<p class="command">
    web_port=8080
</p>

<p>
    If you wanted to use port 593 for just the client, you would add the following line:
</p>

<p class="command">
    web_port_client=593
</p>
</p>

<p>
    If you want to run the client as a background process, reload <span class="code">supervisor</span>.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo supervisorctl reload
</p>

<p>
    If you want to run the client on demand, run the following command from the
    <span class="filename">nyzoVerifier</span> directory:
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo java -jar build/libs/nyzoVerifier-1.0.jar co.nyzo.verifier.client.Client
</p>
