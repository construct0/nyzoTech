<h1>Messages</h1>

<p>
    This page will include descriptions of all messages used in Nyzo. Only currently used messages will be included.
</p>

<h2>Standard-operation messages</h2>

<p class="italic">
    The 200 - 299 range is defined as "test messages" in the current code comments. However, the ping (200/201) message
    pair, which is the only message pair in the range, is used in standard operation. The test range will be absorbed
    into the standard operation range, which will encompass 0 - 299. In anticipation of this change, the ping (200) and
    ping response (201) are currently included in this section.

            lists.

            Sent in response to a mesh request. Returns a list of all nodes in the cycle. Each node includes identifier,
            IP address, TCP port, and queue timestamp according to the responding verifier. Currently has a maximum size

        <div>43</div>
        <div>
            Sent to request registering or updating a verifier's entry on another verifier. If the sending verifier is
            in-cycle or the update does not result in an identifier change at the IP address, this results in an
            immediate update. If the sending verifier is out-of-cycle and the message would either result in an

            a human-readable message explaining acceptance or rejection of the request. If the request was accepted,
            initiates a pull of the latest code from the remote repository, a rebuild, and a restart. This message was

<h2>Debugging messages</h2>

<p class="italic">
    This is described as "debugging and private messages" in the current code, and the whitelist request (424) and
    response (425) are currently included in this range. As the standard-operation range already includes several other
    private (self-signed) messages, the whitelist request and response would be more appropriately located in that
    range.
