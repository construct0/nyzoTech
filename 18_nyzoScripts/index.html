<h1>NyzoScript</h1>

<p>
    This section will include information about the NyzoScript system that is being developed for the
    <a href="https://client.nyzo.co" target="_blank">Nyzo client</a>. This system will provide Turing-complete
    computation that can be registered on and verified by the Nyzo blockchain.
</p>

<p>
    The initial implementation of NyzoScript is being developed to provide server-side functionality for the
    <a href="/micropay/graffitiExample">Micropay graffiti example</a>.
</p>

<p>
    A <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script</span> can be described as a Java interface with the following method
    signature:
</p>

<p class="code-block">
    NyzoScriptState update(NyzoScriptState inputState, List&lt;Transaction&gt; transactions);
</p>

<p>
    A <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>State</span> is composed of the following fields:
</p>

<p class="code-block">
    private final long creationHeight;<br>
    private final long lastUpdateHeight;<br>
    private final byte contentType;<br>
    private final boolean containsUnconfirmedData;<br>
    private final byte[] data;<br>
</p>

<p>
    Even though a NyzoScript returns a full <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>State</span> object, the values it
    provides for <span class="code-mb">creation<wbr>Height</span>, <span class="code-mb">last<wbr>Update<wbr>
    Height</span>, and <span class="code-mb">contains<wbr>Unconfirmed<wbr>Data</span> are not honored. These values are
    set by the script manager. The <span class="code-mb">creation<wbr>Height</span> is the lowest height that
    contributed information to the state, the <span class="code-mb">last<wbr>Update<wbr>Height</span> is the greatest
    height that contributed information to the state thus far, and <span class="code-mb">contains<wbr>Unconfirmed<wbr>
    Data</span> indicates that the state includes consideration of unconfirmed transactions.
