<h1>NyzoScript</h1>

<p>
    This section includes information about the <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script</span> system that is being
    developed for the <a href="https://client.nyzo.co" target="_blank">Nyzo client</a>. The initial implementation of
    this was released in <a href="/releaseNotes/v631">version 631 of the Java codebase</a>. This system will provide
    Turing-complete computation that can be registered on and verified by the Nyzo blockchain.
</p>

<p>
    The initial implementation of <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script</span> was developed to provide server-side
    functionality for the <a href="/micropay/graffitiExample">Micropay graffiti example</a>.
</p>

<p>
    A <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script</span> can be described as a Java interface with the following method
    signature (<span class="italic">to support decentralized cycle governance with scripts, we are working to add the
    current cycle to this interface</span>):
</p>

<p class="code-block">
    Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>State update(Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>State input<wbr>State, List<wbr>&lt;Transaction&gt; transactions);
</p>

<p>
    A <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>State</span> is composed of the following fields:
</p>

<p class="code-block">
    private final long creation<wbr>Height;<br>
    private final long last<wbr>Update<wbr>Height;<br>
    private final byte content<wbr>Type;<br>
    private final boolean contains<wbr>Unconfirmed<wbr>Data;<br>
    private final byte[] data;<br>
</p>

<p>
    Even though a <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script</span> returns a full <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>
    State</span> object, the values it provides for <span class="code-mb">creation<wbr>Height</span>,
    <span class="code-mb">last<wbr>Update<wbr>Height</span>, and <span class="code-mb">contains<wbr>Unconfirmed<wbr>
    Data</span> are not honored. These values are set by the script manager. The <span class="code-mb">creation<wbr>
    Height</span> is the lowest height that contributed information to the state, the <span class="code-mb">last<wbr>
    Update<wbr>Height</span> is the greatest height that contributed information to the state thus far, and
    <span class="code-mb">contains<wbr>Unconfirmed<wbr>Data</span> indicates that the state includes data contributed by
    transactions that have not yet been verified by the cycle.
</p>

<p>
    Each account can have only one <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script</span> registered at one time, and the height
    at which a script is registered is the height at which it becomes active. However, logic internal to a script can
    allow it to be registered before it begins processing transactions.
</p>

<p>
    When a new <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script</span> is registered on an account, it fully replaces the previous
    script, but the state is carried over. However, as with all other behaviors of <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>
    Script</span>s, the internal logic can choose to process the input state however it chooses.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script</span>s will be Turing-complete, but they will not be allowed to access a
    number of functionalities. Networking will be inaccessible, as will typical sources of pseudorandomness and the
    system clock. The block manager will be inaccessible. The system will be designed to ensure that
    <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script</span>s, when they do not contain unconfirmed data, will be fully
    deterministic based on information that is on the blockchain.
</p>

<p>
    When a <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script</span> does contain unconfirmed data, it will produce exactly the same
    output state that it would if the transactions had been confirmed. Without access to the frozen edge or the system
    clock, the <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script</span> will be unable to know whether a transaction is confirmed or
    unconfirmed, and no metadata will be passed with the transaction to indicate confirmed status. The script will also
    be disallowed from persisting data outside its <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>State</span> between calls
    to its <span class="code-mb">update()</span> method.
