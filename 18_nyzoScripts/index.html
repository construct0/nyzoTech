<h1>NyzoScript</h1>

<p>
    This section will include information about the Nyzo<wbr>Script system that is being developed for the
    <a href="https://client.nyzo.co" target="_blank">Nyzo client</a>. This system will provide Turing-complete
    computation that can be registered on and verified by the Nyzo blockchain.
</p>

<p>
    The initial implementation of Nyzo<wbr>Script is being developed to provide server-side functionality for the
    <a href="/micropay/graffitiExample">Micropay graffiti example</a>.
</p>

<p>
    A Nyzo<wbr>Script can be described as a Java interface with the following method signature:
</p>

<p class="code-block">
    Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>State update(Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>State input<wbr>State, List&lt;Transaction&gt; transactions);
</p>

<p>
    A <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>State</span> is composed of the following fields:
</p>

<p class="code-block">
    private final long creationHeight;<br>
    private final long lastUpdateHeight;<br>
    private final byte contentType;<br>
    private final boolean containsUnconfirmedData;<br>
    private final byte[] data;<br>
</p>

<p>
    Even though a NyzoScript returns a full <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>State</span> object, the values it
    provides for <span class="code-mb">creation<wbr>Height</span>, <span class="code-mb">last<wbr>Update<wbr>
    Height</span>, and <span class="code-mb">contains<wbr>Unconfirmed<wbr>Data</span> are not honored. These values are
    set by the script manager. The <span class="code-mb">creation<wbr>Height</span> is the lowest height that
    contributed information to the state, the <span class="code-mb">last<wbr>Update<wbr>Height</span> is the greatest
    height that contributed information to the state thus far, and <span class="code-mb">contains<wbr>Unconfirmed<wbr>
    Data</span> indicates that the state includes data contributed by transactions that have not yet been verified by
    the cycle.
</p>

<p>
    Each account can have only one <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script</span> registered at one time, and the height
    at which a script is registered is the height at which it becomes active. However, logic internal to a script can
    allow it to be registered before it begins processing transactions.
</p>

<p>
    When a new <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script</span> is registered on an account, it fully replaces the previous
    script, but the state is carried over.
</p>

<p>
    NyzoScripts will be Turing-complete, but they will not be allowed to access a number of functionalities. Networking
    will be inaccessible, as will typical sources of pseudorandomness and the system clock. The system will be designed
    to ensure that NyzoScripts, when they do not contain unconfirmed data, will be fully deterministic based on
    information that is on the blockchain.
