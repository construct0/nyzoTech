<h3>Maintenance fees</h3>

<p>
    Every account except 0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000001 is charged a fee of
    &micro;1 every 500 blocks from its creation for as long as it has a balance greater than 0. This fee is intended
    to combat intentional overwhelming of verifiers through creation of many small accounts, and it is a negligible
    amount for legitimate accounts. The number of blocks per year is just over 4.5 million, and this results in
    maintenance fees of approximately &cap;0.009010 per year per account.
