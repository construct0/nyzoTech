<h3>Maintenance fees</h3>

<p>
    In blockchain version 0, every account except
    <span class="address">0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000001</span> was charged a
    fee of &micro;1 every 500 blocks from its creation for as long as it had a balance greater than 0. This fee was
    intended to combat intentional inflation of the balance list through creation of many small accounts, and it was a
    negligible amount for legitimate accounts.
</p>

<p>
    In blockchain version 1, the maintenance fee was adjusted to &micro;100 every 500 blocks, but the amount was only
    charged to accounts less than &cap;1.
</p>

<p>
    In blockchain version 2, a coding error eliminated maintenance fees entirely. This mistake was corrected in
    <a href="/releaseNotes/v580">Nyzo verifier version 580</a>, restoring the fee structure from blockchain version 1
    for blockchain versions 3 and greater.
