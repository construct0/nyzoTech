<h3>Transaction fees</h3>

<p>
    All transactions incur a 0.25% fee. This fee is split evenly among the verifier of this block and the verifiers
    of the previous nine blocks. For blocks before block 9, the fee is split evenly among the verifier of this block
    and all previous blocks. Transaction fees that cannot be divided evenly are rounded down to the nearest
    micronyzo, and the remainder is rolled over to the next block.
