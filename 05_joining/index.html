<h1>Joining the cycle</h1>

<p class="italic">
    This page was last reviewed at version 595. If the <span class="code">NodeManager</span> class has been updated
    since that version, this page may not reflect the latest behavior. Please review the
    <a href="/releaseNotes">release notes</a> to answer any questions.
</p>

<p>
    When a Nyzo verifier is started, it asks other verifiers for information on the current state of the blockchain.
    The location of verifiers are specified in the file
    <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/trusted_entry_points</span>. A copy of this file is included in the
    Git repository, and it contains entries for <span class="verifier-name">verifier0.nyzo.co</span> through
    <span class="verifier-name">verifier9.nyzo.co</span>. Since the deactivation of the official Nyzo verifiers, these
    names point to multiple arbitrarily selected in-cycle verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    In order to be added to the <span class="code">NodeManager</span>, which is necessary for eventual consideration in
    the lottery, a verifier must be able to send node-join messages from an IP address <span class="italic">and receive
    node-join messages at the same address</span>. Additionally, a verifier must have exclusive control over that IP
    address. If multiple verifiers are broadcasting from an IP address, neither will be entered into the lottery.
</p>

<p>
    The following explanations describe the interactions between a single out-of-cycle verifier and a single in-cycle
    verifier. The end result of this process is addition to the lottery pool <span class="italic">of that in-cycle
    verifier</span>. Because this is a democratic system, and because the in-cycle verifier has only a single vote, the
    out-of-cycle verifier must repeat this process with the entire cycle in order to have an optimal probability of
    joining the cycle.
</p>

<p>
    The first step for a new verifier is requesting the cycle from trusted entry points. Due to code changes over time,
    the following code refers to the "mesh," and that term is incorrect. The "mesh" is an early term that described the
    set of all in-cycle and out-of-cycle nodes, and it has fallen out of favor in our development as the separation
    between the cycle and candidate (out-of-cycle) nodes has arisen. This code actually requests just the list of
    in-cycle nodes from the trusted entry points.
</p>

<p class="code-block">
    // Send mesh requests to all trusted entry points.<br>
    AtomicInteger numberOfMeshResponsesPending = new AtomicInteger(trustedEntryPoints.size());<br>
    for (TrustedEntryPoint entryPoint : trustedEntryPoints) {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fetchMesh(entryPoint, numberOfMeshResponsesPending);<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sendNodeJoinMessage(entryPoint);<br>
    }
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">fetchMesh()</span> method, a node-join message is enqueued for every node in the response.
    So, as long as one trusted entry point is aware of a node, this node will send a join message to it.
</p>

<p class="code-block">
    private static void fetchMesh(TrustedEntryPoint entryPoint, AtomicInteger numberOfMeshResponsesPending) {<br>
    <br>
    <span class="pad">    </span>Message meshRequest = new Message(MessageType.MeshRequest15, null);<br>
    <span class="pad">    </span>Message.fetchTcp(entryPoint.getHost(), entryPoint.getPort(), meshRequest,
    new MessageCallback() {<br>
    <span class="pad">        </span>@Override<br>
    <span class="pad">        </span>public void responseReceived(Message message) {<br>
    <br>
    <span class="pad">            </span>// Enqueue node-join requests for all nodes in the response.<br>
    <span class="pad">            </span>MeshResponse response = (MeshResponse) message.getContent();<br>
    <span class="pad">            </span>for (Node node : response.getMesh()) {<br>
    <span class="pad">                </span>NodeManager.enqueueNodeJoinMessage(node.getIpAddress(),
    node.getPortTcp());<br>
    <span class="pad">            </span>}<br>
    <br>
    <span class="pad">            </span>numberOfMeshResponsesPending.decrementAndGet();<br>
    <span class="pad">        </span>}<br>
    <span class="pad">    </span>});<br>
    }
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">NodeManager.enqueueNodeJoinMessage()</span> method adds an entry to a map, keyed on the IP
    address of the receiver. This provides natural de-duplication when the same node is received in the
    <span class="code">MeshResponse</span> from multiple trusted entry points.
</p>

<p class="code-block">
    public static void enqueueNodeJoinMessage(byte[] ipAddress, int port) {<br>
    <br>
    <span class="pad">    </span>nodeJoinRequestQueue.put(ByteBuffer.wrap(ipAddress), port);<br>
    }
</p>

<p>
    After the responses are received from the trusted entry points, this node sends node-join requests to all nodes in
    the node-join request queue.
</p>

<p class="code-block">
    // Instruct the node manager to send the node-join messages. The queue is based on IP address, so deduping<br>
    // naturally occurs and only one request is typically sent to each node at this point. The -1 value tells<br>
    // the node manager to empty the queue.<br>
    NodeManager.sendNodeJoinRequests(-1);
</p>

<p>
    As we can see here, in its initialization process, a verifier should send node-join requests to every verifier in
    the cycle. This behavior applies to both in-cycle and out-of-cycle verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    After initial clearing of the node-join queue, the verifier initializes the local blockchain state. It then clears
    the node-join request queue a second time in case some delayed responses from trusted entry points have caused
    additional entries to be added.
</p>

<p class="code-block">
    ChainInitializationManager.initializeFrozenEdge(trustedEntryPoints);<br>
    <br>
    // In order to process efficiently, we need to be well-connected to the cycle. If there are slow-downs that<br>
    // have prevented connection to this point, they should be addressed before entering the main verifier loop.<br>
    // We set 75% of the current cycle as a threshold, as it is the minimum required for automatic consensus.<br>
    NodeManager.sendNodeJoinRequests(-1);<br>
    NodeManager.updateActiveVerifiersAndRemoveOldNodes();<br>
</p>

<p>
    A verifier should have sufficient connection to the cycle at this point. If it does not, a supplemental connection
    process continues to fetch the cycle from trusted entry points and send node-join requests to the nodes in the
    responses.
</p>

<p class="code-block">

</p>

<p>
    When considering this process, keep in mind that connectedness to the cycle serves different purposes for in-cycle
    and out-of-cycle verifiers. For in-cycle verifiers, connectedness to the rest of the cycle is essential for
    maintaining communication necessary to build the blockchain. While in-cycle-to-in-cycle connectedness is crucial for
    proper operation of Nyzo, it is not especially interesting when considering the process of admitting new verifiers
    to the cycle.
</p>

<p>
    Out-of-cycle verifiers have no responsibility for building the blockchain, and they have no power in the system at
    all. For them, connectedness serves a different purpose. Maintaining an exclusive presence at a particular IP
    address lets in-cycle verifiers know that an out-of-cycle verifier controls the IP address. IP addresses are the
    scarce resource used to control admission into the new-verifier lottery.
</p>

<p>
    In the verifier run loop, a block of "mesh-maintenance" operations is performed roughly once per block duration. As
    the comment explains, these operations continue to be performed at a regular time interval even if the blockchain is
    not freezing blocks at normal speed.
</p>

<p class="code-block">
    // These are mesh-maintenance operations. These were previously performed when a block was frozen,<br>
    // but they have been moved to a separate condition, based on block interval, to ensure that they<br>
    // still happen regularly when the cycle is experiencing problems or for an out-of-cycle verifier<br>
    // that is not always tracking the blockchain.<br>

    <span class="pad">    </span>lastMeshMaintenanceTimestamp = System.currentTimeMillis();<br>

<p>
    We have seen several calls to the <span class="code">NodeManager.sendNodeJoinRequests()</span> method. In
    <span class="code">NodeManager</span>, the queue of node-join requests is stored as a map of IP addresses to port
    numbers. This method simply removes some number of IP addresses from the map, retrieving their port numbers, and
    sends node-join requests to those IP addresses on the specified ports. Positive argument values indicate sending a
    specified maximum number of messages from the queue, while negative argument values indicate emptying the queue.

<p>
    Now that we have examined how verifiers send node-join requests, we should look at how verifiers process those
    requests. As mentioned above, in-cycle and out-of-cycle verifiers both send these requests, but they serve different
    purposes for in-cycle and out-of-cycle verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">MeshListener</span>, a set is defined with message types that are not allowed over UDP.
    Because IP addresses can be spoofed over UDP, node-join requests and node-join responses are disallowed. As the
    comment explains, node-join responses are not processed on incoming connections. However, adding the response type
    to this set improves robustness and readability.
</p>

<p class="code-block">
    // To promote forward compatibility with messages we might want to add, the verifier will accept all readable<br>
    // messages except those explicitly disallowed. The response types should not be processed for incoming
    messages,<br>
    // but adding them to this set adds another level of protection.<br>
    private static final Set&lt;MessageType&gt; disallowedUdpTypes =
    new HashSet&lt;&gt;(Arrays.asList(MessageType.NodeJoinV2_43,<br>
    <span class="pad">        </span>MessageType.NodeJoinResponseV2_44));
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">MeshListener.readDatagramPacket()</span> method, this set is used to ensure that UDP
    messages of these types are ignored.
</p>

<p class="code-block">
    <span class="code-block-ellipsis">...</span><br>
    if (message != null && !disallowedUdpTypes.contains(message.getType())) {<br>
    <span class="code-block-ellipsis">...</span>
</p>

<p>
    This provides an important guarantee for node-join messages. Due to the nature of TCP connection negotiation, the
    receiver of these messages knows with certainty that the messages actually originate from the IP address where they
    claim to originate.
</p>

<p>
    Node-join requests received over TCP, along with responses to locally initiated node-join requests (also sent over
    TCP), are relayed to <span class="code">NodeManager.updateNode()</span>.

<p>
    In earlier versions of Nyzo, the <span class="code">NodeManager.updateNode()</span> method was called for several
    different messages. Its scope was reduced to accommodate the sentinel, and its scope has been reduced further to
    tighten the security of the <span class="code">NodeManager</span>. The latest significant change was in
    <a href="/releaseNotes/v572">version 572</a>, which eliminated immediate reciprocal node-join messages to cap the
    rate at which new verifiers can be added to the queue. In <a href="/releaseNotes/v595">version 595</a>, legacy
    node-join messages were removed to improve code readability.

    This method now responds to only four messages: <span class="code">NodeJoinV2_43</span>,
    <span class="code">NodeJoinResponseV2_44</span>, <span class="code">MissingBlockVoteRequest23</span>, and
    <span class="code">MissingBlockRequest25</span>.
</p>

<p>
    Looking at <span class="code">disallowedNonCycleTypes</span> in the <span class="code">Message</span> class, we can
    see that <span class="code">MissingBlockVoteRequest23</span> and <span class="code">MissingBlockRequest25</span>
    will only be processed if they are received from in-cycle verifiers. So, these will not affect the join queue.

<p class="code-block">
    private static final Set&lt;MessageType&gt; disallowedNonCycleTypes =
    new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(MessageType.BlockVote19,<br>
    <span class="pad">        </span>MessageType.NewVerifierVote21, MessageType.MissingBlockVoteRequest23,
    MessageType.MissingBlockRequest25));
