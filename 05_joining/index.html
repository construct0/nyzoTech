<h1>Joining the mesh</h1>

<p>
    When a Nyzo verifier is started, it asks other verifiers for information on the current state of the blockchain.
    The location of verifiers are specified in the file
    <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/trusted_entry_points</span>. A copy of this file is included in the
    Git repository, and it contains entries for <span class="verifier-name">verifier0.nyzo.co</span> through
    <span class="verifier-name">verifier9.nyzo.co</span>. Since the deactivation of the official Nyzo verifiers, these
    names point to multiple arbitrarily selected in-cycle verifiers.

    In order to be added to the node manager, which is necessary for eventual consideration in the lottery, a verifier
    must be able to send node-join messages from an IP address and receive node-join messages at the same address.
