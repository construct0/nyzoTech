    When a Nyzo verifier is started, it asks other verifiers for information on the current state of the blockchain.
    The location of verifiers are specified in the file
    <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/trusted_entry_points</span>. A copy of this file is included in the
    Git repository, and it contains entries for <span class="verifier-name">verifier0.nyzo.co</span> through
    <span class="verifier-name">verifier9.nyzo.co</span>. Since the deactivation of the official Nyzo verifiers, these
    names point to multiple arbitrarily selected in-cycle verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    In order to be added to the <span class="code">NodeManager</span>, which is necessary for eventual consideration in
    the lottery, a verifier must be able to send node-join messages from an IP address <span class="italic">and receive
    node-join messages at the same address</span>. Additionally, a verifier must have exclusive control over that IP
    address. If multiple verifiers are broadcasting from an IP address, neither will be entered into the lottery.
</p>

<p>
    The following explanations describe the interactions between a single out-of-cycle verifier and a single in-cycle
    verifier. The end result of this process is addition to the lottery pool <span class="italic">of that in-cycle
    verifier</span>. Because this is a democratic system, and because the in-cycle verifier has only a single vote, the
    out-of-cycle verifier must repeat this process with the entire cycle in order to have an optimal probability of
    joining the cycle.
