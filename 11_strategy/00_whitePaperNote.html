<h1>Nyzo white paper notes, #1</h1>

<p class="emphasis">
    This note documents an important change to the white paper. This change was published on 2019-01-13.
</p>

<p>
    In the original white paper, the first paragraph of the <span class="italic">Democratization</span>
    section was as follows:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    To ensure complete democratization, we will deactivate all of our verifiers (verifier0.nyzo.co through
    verifier9.nyzo.co), and we will stop committing code to the nyzoVerifier repository on GitHub, within 12 months
    of the Genesis block. The repository will remain as a reference, but we hope that multiple other repositories will
    emerge to continue to support Nyzo. If we continued to develop the codebase ourselves, or if we turned the codebase
    over to others, this would be a de facto authoritative implementation of Nyzo. The Nyzo protocol is so simple that
    we think there should be several implementations that dominate the landscape, not a single authoritative
    implementation.
</p>

<p>
    This paragraph has been replaced with the following two paragraphs:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    To ensure complete democratization, we will deactivate all of our verifiers (verifier0.nyzo.co through
    verifier9.nyzo.co) within 12 months of the Genesis block. We had originally planned to stop committing code to the
    official Nyzo repository as well, continuing our work on forks or other implementations of Nyzo without revealing
    our identities as original developers of Nyzo. We had planned this because we have seen too many open-source
    projects that start out with great ideas from a small group or an individual, only to be held back later due
    to deference to that group's or individual's opinions instead of the better ideas of the community at large.
    Open source doesn't live up to its full potential when only one team controls all the important decisions.
    <br><br>
    However, we now feel that stopping contributions the official repository so soon after the start of the blockchain
    would be harmful to the progress of the project and would feel like abandonment of the project on our part. We
    still hope that competing implementations of Nyzo will be developed, and the democratic nature of Nyzo means that
    we have no control over which implementation or implementations become dominant in the cycle. So, we plan to
    continue contributing to the official Nyzo repository indefinitely, and we will let the community decide whether
    they want to use our implementation.
