<h1>Verifier responsibilities</h1>

<p>
    The Nyzo cycle is an evolving democracy. Decisions regarding admission to this democracy are obviously important to
    maintenance of the health of the system. However, decisions regarding removal are equally important.
</p>

<p>
    With the introduction of the sentinel in <a href="/releaseNotes/v478">Nyzo version 478</a>, verifiers were removed
    from the cycle much less frequently due to inability to produce blocks. However, this resulted in cycle performance
    issues. To address these cycle performance issues, a verifier performance score was added in
    <a href="/releaseNotes/v505">Nyzo version 505</a>, and enforcement of this score began in
    <a href="/releaseNotes/v508">Nyzo version 508</a>.
</p>

<p>
    While the verifier performance score has worked reasonably well to this point, it does not account for all of the
    responsibilities a verifier should assume to ensure good cycle performance. This page will explore some of these
    responsibilities necessary to ensure that all verifiers are performing their fair share of work to keep the cycle
    processing smoothly.
