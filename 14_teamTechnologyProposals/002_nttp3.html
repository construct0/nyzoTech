<h1>NTTP-3: cycle transactions (completed)</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo's cycle account is a substantial asset to Nyzo, and responsible stewardship of the cycle fund is necessary to
    ensuring the sustainability of Nyzo.
</p>

<p>
    The current cycle-transaction mechanism is functional but impractical. This proposal seeks to improve it in several
    ways.
</p>

<p>
    Please create a cycle transaction for "NTTP-3" to indicate support for the entire proposal. Please create a cycle
    transaction with a more precise identifier (e.g., "NTTP-3/1" or "NTTP-3/2") to indicate support for an item only.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    NTTP-3/1: we propose immediately storing proposed cycle transactions and cycle votes on the blockchain. The ability
    to cast negative ("no") votes would also be added, though they would not affect the threshold required for approval.
    The tally of votes would be maintained in the balance list. When a cycle transaction receives enough votes, it would
    be processed immediately.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    NTTP-3/2: we propose reducing the threshold for cycle-transaction approval from >75% to >50% of the current cycle.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    NTTP-3/3: we propose limiting the sum of cycle transactions processed in any 10,000-block period to no more than
    &cap;100,000. This, combined with NTTP-1, would allow the cycle to avoid large cycle-fund losses in the case of
    widespread compromise of cycle aliases. If this and NTTP-3/1 are both implemented, approved transactions would be
    processed as soon as the 10,000-block window allows, but aliases could be changed within that window to revoke
    approval and prevent large numbers of malicious transactions from being processed.

<h2>
    <a name="approval">Approval</a>
</h2>

<p>
    NTTP-3 was approved by the cycle in a cycle transaction from <span class="verifier-name">Myrgtabrakke</span>
    (<span class="code">0a05401103d5cd18-60ad56a6d9d79c3b-6c46ab456d86539a-bd007bb7bca601ed</span>) to
    <span class="verifier-name">Nyzo 0</span>
    (<span class="code">b5fd3e8d789a5055-091e46db881f1b74-1b0ab6f8d65b21ae-88cc543dfd92173b</span>). This transaction
    was successfully incorporated into
    <a href="http://client.nyzo.co/transactionSearch?blockHeight=6400000&action=run" target="_blank">block
        6,400,000</a>. Since the transaction is in the blockchain, plans to store its signatures as on-chain metadata
    are no longer necessary.
</p>

<h2>
    <a name="implementation">Implementation</a>
</h2>

<p>
    The software changes will be implemented and made available in the
    <a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> no later than
    2020-03-12 03:06:40.000 UTC. The activation height for the upgrade from blockchain v1 to blockchain v2 will be
    7,000,000. This block's start timestamp is 2020-04-02 03:06:40.000 UTC. This will allow operators at least 3 weeks
    (21 days) to upgrade their verifiers, sentinels, and supporting systems.
</p>

<h2>
    <a name="deployment">Deployment</a>
</h2>

<p>
    The software changes were implemented in <a href="/releaseNotes/v573">version 573</a>. The blockchain upgrade
    occurred at block 7,000,000, verified at 2020-04-02 03:06:48.645 UTC.
