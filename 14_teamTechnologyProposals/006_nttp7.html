<h1>NTTP-7: linear IP lottery (completed)</h1>

<p>
    We do not see the lottery situation of unresponsive verifiers as a problem that needs to be fixed. If an individual
    is following the current rules to be in the lottery, then that person should stay in the lottery. The proof of
    diversity has not been compromised. IPv4 addresses are still scarce, there is no evidence that a single entity
    controls greater than 50% of the lottery, and there is certainly no evidence that a single entity has gained an
    appreciable portion of the cycle.
</p>

<p>
    Also, it is important to note that even an elimination of the scarcity of IPv4 addresses would not compromise the
    proof of diversity. It would only necessitate finding a new source of scarcity for admission into the cycle. The
    proof of diversity is a provable (and disprovable) system regarding the evolution of a malleable democracy, and it
    could be based on any scarce resource as a factor for admission, including KYC (know your customer) to provide for
    a one-person, one-ticket probability of entrance. As many community members will remember, the initial entrance
    scheme was a FIFO entrance queue, not a lottery, and this was still (minimally) sufficient to support the proof.
</p>

<p>
    As we have stated many times, we hope to see competing implementations of Nyzo arise. We are glad to see verifiers
    running code that we have not written. We think this is a huge step forward in the progression of Nyzo.
</p>

<p>
    We also recognize the value of improving the default solution that is present in our version of the code. We think
    that the linear IP ideas presented in
    <a href="https://github.com/Open-Nyzo/Nyzo-Q" target="_blank">Open-Nyzo/Nyzo-Q</a> are especially suited to
    improving diversity.

<p class="emphasis">
    NTTP-7: we propose changing the lottery calculation space from verifier identifier to IP address
</p>

<p>
    This dramatic of a change should not be performed without thorough consideration. As our implementation of Nyzo is
    currently dominant in the cycle, we should assume that the changes we make will have a significant impact on the
    behavior of the cycle in the near future.
</p>

<p>
    We cannot and do not know the effort expended to obtain current positions in the lottery. However, two assumptions
    are reasonable:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Many IP addresses close together in the IP address space likely represent a smaller effort than the same number
        of IP addresses spread far apart in the address space.</li>
    <li>Favoring increased diversity in the IP address space will favor geographic diversity and other forms of
        diversity.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    These two items are related, and "other forms of diversity" is deliberately vague. It is reasonable to assume, due
    to the complex history of IP address allocation, that favoring dissimilarity among IP addresses will favor
    dissimilarity among the people who are able to enter the cycle. To the extent possible, we want the Nyzo cycle to be
    as diverse as those using Nyzo for transactions. As we hope for every person on this planet to use Nyzo in some
    fashion, this requires an exceptionally diverse cycle.
</p>

<p>
    So, while this change will possibly disfavor some people who have a large number of lottery positions, we feel that
    it is <span class="emphasis">justified and fair because this relative disfavor will be more than offset by the
    increase in overall value of the system due to increased diversity</span>.
</p>

<p>
    In fact, we assert that diversity is so important to Nyzo that increasing diversity always increases the
    trustworthiness of the system so significantly that it actually benefits those who have less control of the system
    due to increased diversity. An example we have presented many times to illustrate this is that of the Genesis cycle:
    we controlled 100% of it, and Nyzo was valueless because we controlled 100% of it.
