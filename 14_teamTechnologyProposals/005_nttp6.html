<h1>NTTP-6: sentinel disk-space monitoring</h1>

<p>
    A sentinel will continue to operate properly and protect its verifiers even if it runs out of disk space. However,
    it will be unable to write new block files to disk. The next time the sentinel process initializes, it will not have
    recent blocks, and it will have to follow the blockchain for 4 cycles to begin protecting its managed verifiers
    again.
</p>

<p>
    To ensure that sentinel disk-space issues do not go unnoticed, indication of available disk space could be added to
    the sentinel web interface. This would allow sentinel operators to easily track disk space across multiple sentinels
    without the need for separate monitoring tools.

    NTTP-6: we propose adding disk-space monitoring to the sentinel web interface
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">Available disk space</span> would be displayed above the <span class="code">Protecting
    verifiers</span> line in the top section of the sentinel interface. Color-coding
    (<span style="background-color: #080; color: white; padding: 3px;">green</span>,
    <span style="background-color: #ff0; padding: 3px;">yellow</span>,
    <span style="background-color: #f00; color: white; padding: 3px;">red</span>) would be
    according to user-adjustable thresholds.
