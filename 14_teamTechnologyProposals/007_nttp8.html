<h1>NTTP-8: elimination of queue</h1>

<p>
    From <a href="nttp7">NTTP-7</a>, which switched to a linear IP lottery based on ideas implemented in
    <a href="https://github.com/Open-Nyzo/Nyzo-Q" target="_blank">Open-Nyzo/Nyzo-Q</a>:
</p>

    Also, it is important to note that even an elimination of the scarcity of IPv4 addresses would not compromise the
    proof of diversity. It would only necessitate finding a new source of scarcity for admission into the cycle. The
    proof of diversity is a provable (and disprovable) system regarding the evolution of a malleable democracy, and it
    could be based on any scarce resource as a factor for admission, including KYC (know your customer) to provide for
    a one-person, one-ticket probability of entrance. As many community members will remember, the initial entrance
    scheme was a FIFO entrance queue, not a lottery, and this was still (minimally) sufficient to support the proof.

    As we have stated many times, we hope to see competing implementations of Nyzo arise. We are glad to see verifiers
    running code that we have not written. We think this is a huge step forward in the progression of Nyzo.
</p>

<p>
    As we also noted in NTTP-7:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    We also recognize the value of improving the default solution that is present in our version of the code.
</p>

<p>
    We also disagree about the nature of node-join floods. We think this is a natural behavior of the system, and others
    see it as malice. However, we do not have to agree on the source of the problem in order to solve the problem.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    We propose eliminating the queue and delegating entrance decisions to an external data source. We ask that
    <a href="https://github.com/EggPool" target="_blank">EggPool</a> provide an endpoint, and this endpoint will be
    used as the default in our version of the Nyzo code.
</p>

<p>
    This will eliminate any valid reason for large numbers of out-of-cycle nodes to send node-join messages. So, if
    node-join floods continue, we will agree that they are malicious.
</p>

<p>
    We would like to imagine that whatever entrance mechanism the community chooses to implement will help to build
    trust. As anonymity and interaction with the Discord community are of concern, we would suggest that
    something like the following would be a good initial solution:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Potential members express their interest on Discord.</li>
    <li>Members of the community help them to set up verifiers and sentinels, ensuring that their configurations are
    correct and robust.</li>
    <li>EggPool adds the member's identifier to a list to be served from the specified server.</li>
    <li>The Nyzo verifiers fetch the identifier from EggPool's endpoint, vote for the identifier, and the new member
        will be admitted.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Of course, the community can do whatever they choose to do with this mechanism. We feel that EggPool's investment of
    time and effort into the join issue makes them the ideal caretaker of this part of the system.
</p>

<h2>
    Implementation price
</h2>

<p>
    This NTTP will be implemented if &cap;1 is sent to address
    <span class="wallet-identifier">id__82StPf3LUpz--a~JnZ~HBdWM9Qqzc~Ecef5R1eFA67zayJIZ_NT8</span>. We ask that the
    cycle send an additional &cap;400,000 to this account at a future time, at the sole discretion of EggPool, after the
    solution is implemented and working to the community's satisfaction.
