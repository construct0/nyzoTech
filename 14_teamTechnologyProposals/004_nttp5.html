<h1>NTTP-5: Micropay for Chrome extension</h1>

<p>
    The internet needs a native currency. Content creators around the world create the value of the internet, but large
    companies extract much of that value. If the internet had a native currency on which content creators could
    consistently rely, creators could monetize their content directly with consumers.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    NTTP-5: we propose adding Nyzo Micropay functionality to the Chrome extension.
</p>

<p>
    This NTTP would include the initial integration of Micropay functionality in the Chrome extension and example
    server-side code that would provide content to users based on payment status. The server-side code would be
    implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier" target="_blank">Nyzo verifier codebase</a> in
    Java. Alternate implementations of the server side of the process, such as WordPress plugin integration, would be
    the subject of other NTTPs.
</p>

<p>
    On a Micropay-enabled page, the user would be presented with premium content with a message that the content could
    be unlocked by making a payment in Nyzo.

<p>
    The user would make a payment with the Nyzo extension.

<p>
    The premium content would be presented to the user. A cookie would be placed to allow the user to revisit the
    content for a short time without making an additional payment.
