<h1>NTTP-4: WordPress plugin</h1>

<p>
    The <a href="/setupInstructions/chromeBrowserExtension">Nyzo Chrome extension</a> allows tips to be sent from web
    pages. Supporting the Nyzo Chrome extension is exceptionally simple. It requires the addition of only a single
    element with a few simple attributes to the page.
</p>

<p>
    Despite the simplicity of this implementation, the availability of a WordPress plugin often determines whether a
    website operator implements a feature. Also, more sophisticated Chrome extension functionality is planned in the
    future. As such functionality is developed, a WordPress plugin could be improved in parallel to support new features
    of the Chrome extension.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    NTTP-4: we propose developing a simple WordPress plugin. This plugin would allow operators of WordPress sites to
    include Nyzo tip buttons on the pages on their sites.
</p>

<p>
    This NTTP would only cover the initial implementation of the plugin. The plugin would be released into the public
    domain with the <a href="http://unlicense.org" target="_blank">Unlicense</a>, and it would be made available on
    GitHub. Further development of the plugin would not be covered by this NTTP.
