<h1>Nyzo team technology proposals</h1>

<p>
    This section contains technology proposals from the Nyzo team. While verifiers always have the option of
    choosing to update to a new version, the Nyzo team's implementation the Nyzo verifier is still the
    <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span> standard implementation, with no practical alternative branches
    or implementations of the Nyzo verifier yet available. To avoid exercising undue influence on the direction of the
    Nyzo blockchain, we will post our proposals for important behavioral changes here, asking for cycle transactions to
    be approved indicating support of those changes before implementation.
</p>

<p>
    To express support for a Nyzo team proposal, please create a cycle transaction with a sender data field in the
    following format (amount and receiver do not matter):
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">NTTP-1: </span><span style="font-family: monospace; font-style: italic;">&lt;git commit hash of
    any commit containing the version of the proposal you support (raw bytes)&gt;</span>
</p>

<p>
    The first 8 bytes of the sender data, in this example, would be the ASCII encoding of the
    "<span class="code">NTTP-1: </span>" proposal identifier. For a higher-numbered proposal, such as NTTP-10 or
    NTTP-100, the number of bytes used by the proposal identifier would be greater than 8.
</p>

<p>
    The final 20 bytes will always be the raw bytes of a git commit hash. Using raw bytes instead of a hexadecimal
    string allows the entire hash to be included in the 32-byte sender data field. The client provides an
    <a href="http://client.nyzo.co/nttpGenerate" target="_blank">NTTP generation command</a>.
