<h1>Cycle transaction signing script</h1>

<p>
    The <span class="code">CycleTransactionSignScript</span> is used to quickly sign a cycle transaction for multiple
    verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    This script relies on a standard sentinel installation. If you do not have a sentinel installation already
    available, configure one by following <a href="/setupInstructions/sentinel">these instructions</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The script requires the initiator signature of a cycle transaction. The easiest way to obtain this signature is from
    the <a href="https://nyzo.co/cycleTransactions" target="_blank">cycle transactions page</a> on the nyzo.co site.
</p>

<p>
    To run the script, open a command line and navigate to the <span class="filename">nyzoVerifier</span> directory.
    Run the following command, replacing the signature in the command below with the signature of the transaction you
    want to sign.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo java -jar build/libs/nyzoVerifier-1.0.jar co.nyzo.verifier.scripts.CycleTransactionSignScript
    sig_g3gMk7KyJM_Kf~5oV~oS1TfULhjEg9JIdXqFfdxsWA-1AyZP3EXDgs39V3eKxSwxLN3ecgUPiPaea5Gd_QGGrgvjtBth
</p>

<p>
    The script will gather some information from the managed verifiers: the frozen edge, the transaction, and a list of
    in-cycle nodes. Then, it will sign the transaction for every managed verifier in the list and send every signature
    to every in-cycle node.
</p>

<p>
    Keep in mind that this script sends a total number of messages that is the multiple of the number of in-cycle nodes
    and the number of managed verifiers. So, running this script with 10 managed verifiers while the cycle has 1600
    nodes will require 16,000 messages, which may take several minutes to send.
