<h1>Cycle transaction signing script</h1>

<p>
    The <span class="code">CycleTransactionSignScript</span> is used to quickly sign a cycle transaction for multiple
    verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    This script relies on a standard sentinel installation. If you do not have a sentinel installation already
    available, configure one by following <a href="/setupInstructions/sentinel">these instructions</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The script requires the initiator signature of a cycle transaction. The easiest way to obtain this signature is from
    the <a href="https://nyzo.co/cycleTransactions" target="_blank">cycle transactions page</a> on the nyzo.co site.
</p>

<p>
    To run the script, open a command line and navigate to the <span class="filename">nyzoVerifier</span> directory.
    Run the following command, replacing the signature in the command below with the signature of the transaction you
    want to sign, and replacing the <span class="code">1</span> value of the second argument with
    <span class="code">0</span> if you want to vote against the transaction.
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo java -jar build/libs/nyzoVerifier-1.0.jar co.nyzo.verifier.scripts.CycleTransactionSignScript
    sig_g3gMk7KyJM_Kf~5oV~oS1TfULhjEg9JIdXqFfdxsWA-1AyZP3EXDgs39V3eKxSwxLN3ecgUPiPaea5Gd_QGGrgvjtBth 1
</p>

<p>
    The script will gather some information from the managed verifiers: the frozen edge, the transaction, a list of
    in-cycle nodes, and the order of the current cycle. Then, it will sign the transaction for every managed verifier in
    the list and send every signature to the 5 verifiers in the cycle most likely to verify it.
</p>

<p>
    For the version-1 blockchain, this script had to send signatures to every verifier in the cycle. In this version,
    only 5 messages will typically need to be sent per managed verifier. At a cycle length of 2000, this reduces overall
    traffic by 99.75%. So, if you have 50 managed verifiers, the script will typically send 250 messages total.
