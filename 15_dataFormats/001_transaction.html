<h1>Transaction</h1>

<p>
    The structure of the transaction depends on the type of the transaction. All transactions begin with a transaction
    type followed by a timestamp. The timestamp determines block membership of the transaction. Every transaction has
    one and only one block in which it can be incorporated. If the transaction is not incorporated in that block, there
    is no possibility of the transaction being incorporated in a later block.
</p>

<p>
    All transactions except coin-generation transactions contain signatures. Coin-generation transactions are only
    allowed in block 0, the Genesis block. Therefore, all transactions past the Genesis block are signed.
