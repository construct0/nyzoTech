<h1>System design</h1>

<p>
    Micropay currently supports two use cases: sending tips and paying for content. A third use case, playing games, is
    currently in development.
</p>

<h2>Sending tips</h2>

<p class="italic">
    This section will explain the Micropay mechanism for sending tips.
</p>

<h2>Paying for content</h2>

<p class="italic">
    This section will explain the Micropay mechanism for purchasing content.
</p>

<h2>Playing games</h2>

<p>
    Extended Micropay functionality for playing games is currently in development. For games, users will pre-approve a
    maximum amount to be used for the transactions that will record game states. The web page will then generate the
    necessary transaction information in the course of game play, and it will interact with the Chrome extension or the
    mobile application to produce and sign the necessary transactions.
