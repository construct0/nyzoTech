<h1>Complex article example</h1>

<p>
    Other pages in this section show how to use Micropay for purchase of an <a href="articleExample">article</a>, an
    <a href="imageExample">image</a>, and <a href="multipleItemExample">multiple items on one page</a>. However, most
    web content will be substantially more complex than this. To demonstrate that Micropay is suitable for actual
    content sites, this page will show how to efficiently protect multiple web resources with Micropay and authorize
    them with a single transaction.

<p>
    Like anything with Micropay, behavior is decided by the server delivering content. This example will fit existing
    Nyzo documentation server functionality by using the same receiver identifier, sender data, and amount for all
    resources on this page.
