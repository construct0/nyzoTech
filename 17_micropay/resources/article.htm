    This is the part of the article that is delivered when payment is made. Delivery can be made instantly. Instead of
    waiting for the transaction's block to be processed, the web server can forward the transaction to a Nyzo client,
    and the Nyzo client can respond with information that lets the web server decide whether the transaction is likely
    to be processed successfully. While this will doubtlessly result in some payments being lost and some content being
    delivered essentially for free, the system can be refined over time to minimize such losses.

    We think that Nyzo Micropay could be wonderful for the internet. Content creators could spend more time on the
    creation of engaging, valuable content, and consumers could directly purchase content they want. Distracting ads
    could be removed from websites, and ad revenue could potentially be replaced many times over by direct payments from
    consumers.
