<p>
    Take a survey of all the nations of the world, peruse all the books that you please, and you will find the liberty
    of man, the free will of his actions, the influence of his will over his passions, only in the theosophical
    tradition. Wherever you see physical or metaphysical systems, doctrines of whatever kind they may be, founded upon a
    sole principle of the material or spiritual Universe, you can conclude boldly that absolute fatality results from it
    and that their authors find themselves in need of making two things one: or of explaining the origin of good and
    evil, which is impossible; or of establishing the free will <span style="italic">a priori</span>, which is a
    manifest contradiction of their reasonings.
