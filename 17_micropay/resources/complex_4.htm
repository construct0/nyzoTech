    Partly through mathematical, and partly through experimental research, physical science has of late years assumed a
    momentous position in the world. Both in a material and in an intellectual point of view it has produced, and it is
    destined to produce, immense changes, vast social ameliorations, and vast alterations in the popular conception of
    the origin, rule, and governance of things. Miracles are wrought by science in the physical world, while philosophy
    is forsaking its ancient metaphysical channels, and pursuing those opened or indicated by scientific research. This
    must become more and more the case as philosophic writers become more deeply imbued with the methods of science,
    better acquainted with the facts which scientific men have won, and with the great theories which they have
    elaborated.
