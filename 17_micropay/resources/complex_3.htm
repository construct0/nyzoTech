    Kant, who first emphasized this contradiction, deduced the impossibility of space and time, which he declared to be
    merely subjective; and since his time very many philosophers have believed that space and time are mere appearance,
    not characteristic of the world as it really is. Now, however, owing to the labours of the mathematicians, notably
    Georg Cantor, it has appeared that the impossibility of infinite collections was a mistake. They are not in fact
    self-contradictory, but only contradictory of certain rather obstinate mental prejudices. Hence the reasons for
    regarding space and time as unreal have become inoperative, and one of the great sources of metaphysical
    constructions is dried up.
