<h3>
    Complex text example 2
</h3>

<p>
    It is, perhaps, worth while to observe that those prepositions, which in modern languages hold the place of the
    ancient cases, are, of all others, the most general, and abstract, and metaphysical; and of consequence, would
    probably be the last invented. Ask any man of common acuteness, What relation is expressed by the preposition
    <span class="italic">above</span>? He will readily answer, that of <span class="italic">superiority</span>. By the
    preposition <span class="italic">below</span>? He will as quickly reply that of
    <span class="italic">inferiority</span>. But ask him, what relation is expressed by the preposition
    <span class="italic">of</span>, and, if he has not beforehand employed his thoughts a good deal upon these subjects,
    you may safely allow him a week to consider of his answer.
