<h1>Micropay</h1>

<p>
    Micropay is a system for making small, low-effort transactions using Nyzo. The system is structured to allow the
    receiver of the transaction to have a reasonable certainty that a transaction will be incorporated into the
    blockchain, which allows instant delivery of digital goods with low risk of non-payment.
