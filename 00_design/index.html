<h1>Design</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo is an open-source, highly decentralized, democratic, and highly efficient blockchain. The block time is seven
    seconds, and the system scales well to high transaction volumes. This is not like most of the new coins you see:
    this is not a derivative of another project, and it is not just a few new features or a slight design change from
    other projects. This is all-new code, built from the ground up to be the most efficient, most democratic,
    easiest-to-use cryptocurrency in the world.
</p>

<h2>Terminology and symbols</h2>

<p>
    Coins in this system are called &ldquo;nyzo&rdquo; (plural &ldquo;nyzos&rdquo;). The prefix for a nyzo is the
    mathematical intersection symbol, &cap;. So, &ldquo;5 nyzos&rdquo; would be written as &ldquo;&cap;5.&rdquo; The
    smallest unit of measurement is the micronyzo. A micronyzo is 1/1,000,000 of a nyzo. The prefix for a micronyzo is
    the lowercase Greek letter mu, &micro;. So, &ldquo;15 micronyzos&rdquo; would be written as &micro;15. To avoid
    ambiguity and to eliminate rounding issues, all transactions are handled at the programmatic and blockchain levels
    in terms of micronyzos, and fractional micronyzos cannot be specified anywhere in the system.
</p>

<p>
    Several &ldquo;edges&rdquo; are discussed in this system. The &ldquo;frozen edge&rdquo; is the highest block that a
    verifier has agreed it will never change, and the consensus mechanism is built to extend the frozen edge as quickly
    as possible while ensuring that no two verifiers acting in good faith ever freeze different blocks at the same
    level. The &ldquo;trailing edge&rdquo; is the lowest block that was necessary to determine the state of the frozen
    edge, and the &ldquo;retention edge&rdquo; is the lowest block for which a verifier will service normal requests.
    The frozen edge and trailing edge are precisely defined based on characteristics of the blockchain, while
    the retention edge is an arbitrary buffer behind the trailing edge that is useful in bootstrapping new
    verifiers.
</p>

<h2>Proof of diversity</h2>

<p>
    The proof-of-diversity blockchain uses analysis of verification cycles to establish the authoritative form of the
    blockchain. This is not proof-of-work, and it is not proof-of-stake. It is a totally new proof system that relies
    on diversity of participation for strength. While proof-of-diversity has its own unique concerns that must be
    addressed to ensure integrity of the blockchain, it is immune to many of the attacks and problems inherent to
    proof-of-work and proof-of-stake systems, and it is significantly more efficient.
</p>

<p>
    The basic concept of proof-of-diversity is simple. Verifiers take turns producing blocks in a circular order. Some
    simple rules ensure that verifiers are neither added to nor removed from that circular order too quickly. In order
    to produce a believable forgery of the blockchain for any meaningful amount of time, an attacker would need to
    obtain more than half of the private keys of verifiers currently working on the blockchain.
</p>

<p>
    For any block in the blockchain, the verification cycle of that block is defined as the longest list of blocks,
    ending with that block, that contains no more than one instance of each verifier. Consider the following
    blockchain, where the number is the block height and the letter is the verifier:
</p>

<p class="block-list">
    20A, 21B, 22C, 23A, 24B, 25C, 26A
</p>

<p>
    In this blockchain, the verification cycle of block 26 contains blocks 26, 25, and 24. The cycle does not contain
    block 23, because verifier A is already in the cycle at block 26. The verification cycle of block 25 contains blocks
    25, 24, and 23. The cycle does not contain block 22, because verifier C is already in the cycle at block 25.
</p>

<p>
    If a verifier is new to the chain, the same definition holds. To illustrate, we add verifier D at block 27:
</p>

<p class="block-list">
    20A, 21B, 22C, 23A, 24B, 25C, 26A, 27D
</p>

<p>
    The verification cycle of block 27 is blocks 27, 26, 25, and 24. The cycle does not contain block 23, because
    verifier A is already present at block 26.
</p>

<p>
    The previous cycle of the block is the cycle immediately before the current cycle. The previous cycle of block 27
    in this example would contain blocks 23, 22, and 21, but not block 20, as verifier A is already present in that
    cycle at block 23.
</p>

<p>
    A &ldquo;new&rdquo; verifier is defined as any verifier other than the last verifier of the previous cycle. An
    &ldquo;existing&rdquo; verifier is defined as the last verifier of the previous cycle. If an existing
    verifier misses a cycle, it will be considered a new verifier the next time it verifies a block.
</p>

<p>
    Building on these definitions, we declare two rules to secure the proof-of-diversity blockchain.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    Proof-of-diversity rule 1: After the first existing verifier in the blockchain, a new verifier is only allowed if
    none of the other blocks in the cycle, the previous cycle, or the two blocks before the previous cycle were
    verified by new verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    This rule exists to ensure that attackers cannot gain control of the chain by quickly introducing verifiers that
    they control. The addition of the two blocks before the previous cycle is to avoid clustering new verifiers in the
    chain.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    Proof-of-diversity rule 2: Past the Genesis block, the cycle of a block must be longer than half of one more than
    the maximum of the all cycle lengths in this cycle and the previous two cycles.
</p>

<p>
    This rule exists to ensure that the majority of the verifiers who are verifying the blockchain cannot be excluded
    by attackers who are trying to take control of the blockchain. In order to control the direction of the chain, one
    must control more than 50% of the current active verifiers. The blocks in this and the previous two cycles are
    considered to avoid divergence at opportunistic moments for verifiers that are clustered around certain parts of
    the chain.
</p>

<p>
    The metric calculated in this rule cannot increase from one block to the next unless the cycle length also
    increases from one block to the next. This is important because it ensures that every block that passes this rule
    can be extended indefinitely.
</p>

<p>
    These are the only two blockchain rules, and together they guarantee that, starting at any point in the blockchain,
    one must control more than half of the active verifiers to continue to produce a valid version of the blockchain.
    Unlike proof of work, which can be manipulated at will by anyone in possession of sufficient computational
    resources, proof of diversity requires active participation in a particular blockchain to have any influence on
    that blockchain.
