<h3>Democratization</h3>

<p>
    To ensure complete democratization, we will deactivate all of our verifiers (verifier0.nyzo.co through
    verifier9.nyzo.co), and we will stop committing code to the nyzoVerifier repository on GitHub, within 12 months of
    the Genesis block. The repository will remain as a reference, but we hope that multiple other repositories will
    emerge to continue to support Nyzo. If we continued to develop the codebase ourselves, or if we turned the codebase
    over to others, this would be a de facto authoritative implementation of Nyzo. The Nyzo protocol is so simple that
    we think there should be several implementations that dominate the landscape, not a single authoritative
    implementation.

<p>
    While the proof-of-diversity blockchain has some rules that must be followed, these rules are incredibly simple,
    and all of the consensus rules can be modified or replaced without jeopardizing the proof of diversity. At any
    point in time, the decisions of the active verifiers in the current verification cycle determine the direction of
    the blockchain.
