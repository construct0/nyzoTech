<h1>Democratization</h1>

<p>
    The Nyzo blockchain was started with 10 "official" Nyzo verifiers. To eliminate potential concerns about those
    verifiers influencing the direction of the blockchain, they were all deactivated and sentinel protection was
    eliminated so they would be removed from the cycle.

<p>
    We initially planned to stop committing code to the <span class="code">nyzoVerifier</span> repository on GitHub
    within 12 months of the Genesis block. However, as no alternative implementations of the core Nyzo verifier software
    are available, we feel that our continued development of the codebase is necessary. We hope that one or more
    alternative implementations arise soon.
</p>

<p>
    The Nyzo protocol is so simple that we think there should be several implementations of Nyzo in common use. While
    the proof-of-diversity blockchain has some rules that must be followed, these rules are minimal, and all of the
    consensus rules can be modified or replaced without jeopardizing the proof of diversity. <span class="emphasis"> At
    any point in time, the decisions of the verifiers in the current verification cycle determine the direction of the
    blockchain.</span>
