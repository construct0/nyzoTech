<h4>
    Vote tabulation and freezing of blocks
</h4>

<p>
    In tallying votes, only votes from verifiers in the frozen edge's verification cycle are counted. A block is frozen
    if the votes for that block exceed three-fourths of the size of the verification cycle in two subsequent vote
    tabulations calculated at least 0.5 seconds apart.
</p>

<p>
    At the three-fourths threshold, more than half of the cycle would have to maliciously
    send different votes to honest verifiers in order to cause a divergence of the chain, assuming the worst case in
    which the remaining honest verifiers are split evenly on which block to freeze.
