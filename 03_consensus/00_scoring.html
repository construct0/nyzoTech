<h4>
    Scoring
</h4>

<p>
    Each block has a score based on the verifier that signed it. A lower score is better than a higher score. At each
    height, an incremental score is calculated relative to the block at the previous height, and the total score of a
    block is the sum of all incremental scores back to the frozen edge.
</p>

<p>
    For a block signed by an existing verifier, the incremental score is zero plus four times the difference between
    the previous block&apos;s cycle length and this block&apos;s cycle length. If the verifier is not active in the
    mesh, five is added to the incremental score.
</p>

<p>
    For a block signed by a new verifier, the incremental score is negative six plus four times the verifier&apos;s
    position (zero-indexed) in the new-verifier vote total list. Twelve is added to the score of a new verifier not
    present in this list, which is limited to a maximum size of three.
