<h4>
    Voting
</h4>

<p>
    A verifier may change its vote for a block several times. Votes are timestamped to prevent replay attacks of old
    votes.
</p>

<p>
    If a block has a score less than 0, a verifier may vote for it immediately after freezing the previous block.
    Otherwise, it must wait 2 seconds minimum plus 20 seconds for each point that a block has above 0. So a
    block with a score of 0 can be voted for after 2 seconds, while a block with a score of 4 can be for after 82
    seconds.
</p>

<p>
    If the leading block in a verifier&apos;s local tabulation has more than 50% of the vote, the verifier changes its
    vote to that block if the verifier is allowed to vote for that block based on its score. If the leading block
    in a verifier&apos;s local tabulation does not have more than 50% of the vote, the verifier changes its vote to that
    block if the verifier was allowed to vote for that block more than 10 seconds ago.
</p>

<p>
    If neither of these conditions is true, the verifier votes for the block with the lowest score if it is allowed to
    cast a vote based on that block's score. Until such a block exists, the verifier waits to cast a vote.
