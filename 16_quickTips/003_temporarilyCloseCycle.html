    <a href="/releaseNotes/v593">Version 593</a> was released on 2020-06-08. Since then, no new stalls have occurred.
    This page will be left in the documentation repository for historical reference.

<p class="strikethrough">
    Due to frequent stalls on the admission of new verifiers, we recommend temporarily closing the cycle to verifier
    admissions. While the stalls can be broken, these situations are incredibly stressful for everyone, and they cause
    credibility issues for the blockchain.
</p>

<p class="strikethrough">
    A short closure to new verifiers (2 to 3 days, most likely) would allow us to examine the problem in depth,
    replicate the issue on a testnet, and release a thoughtful, comprehensive solution without the distraction of
    rushing to release a fix before the next stall happens.
</p>

<p class="strikethrough">
    Also, a short closure will not have a huge impact on waiting verifiers. At the current rate of admission, the
    closure will likely eliminate fewer than 10 join windows.
</p>

<p class="strikethrough">
    To close the cycle, simply cast a manual new-verifier vote for an invalid identifier (such as 0000.0001). This can
    be done using <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteOverrideRequestScript</span>. If enough verifiers cast an invalid
    vote, the new-verifier tally will be unable to exceed 50% for any valid verifier, and no new verifiers will be
    admitted.
</p>

<p class="strikethrough">
    We will also release an update shortly that will include a hard-coded vote override. This will be version 592. The
    override will be removed in version 593. Those who do not wish to close the cycle do not have to update to version
    592. If a verifier skips over 592 to 593, they will never run the code that closes the cycle.
