<h1>Nyzo 546: max score&thinsp;/&thinsp;transaction send</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 546
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/b0a7a87581d1c02447c15260cca10e7c81496aea"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds a maximum performance score and improves the process that the client
    and Micropay server use to send transactions to the cycle.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the verifier, the client, and the Micropay server. It is not an urgent update. The
    modifications in this version were made in the development and testing of the version-1 blockchain update, and they
    are being released now to allow the next version to be more focused.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">VerifierPerformanceManager</span>, a maximum score is now enforced. Various verifier issues
    with connectedness have caused some verifiers to have exceptionally high scores on other verifiers from which
    recovery would be impractical. These scores are not useful in removing problematic verifiers. For practical
    purposes, they are noise in the system. Enforcing this maximum allows the noise to be cleared and allows the
    verifier-performance system to function more accurately and efficiently.

<p>
    In <span class="code">ClientTransactionUtil</span>, the
    <span class="code">sendTransactionToExpectedBlockVerifier()</span> method has been replaced with
    <span class="code">sendTransactionToLikelyBlockVerifiers()</span>.

<p>
    The <span class="code">sendTransactionToExpectedBlockVerifier()</span> method sent a transaction to the single
    in-cycle verifier that was expected to verify the block in which the transaction's timestamp is contained. The
    replacement method uses the same logic to determine which verifier should verify the block that includes the
    transaction, but it also sends the transaction to the verifiers in the positions just before and just after the
    expected verifier in the cycle. This allows the transaction to be successfully incorporated in the blockchain even
    if a single verifier is added or removed between the time the transaction is sent and the time the block is
    produced.

<p>
    When a transaction is not accepted by a verifier, the response from that verifier is now displayed.

<p>
    The <span class="code">MicropayEndpoint</span> class, used by the Micropay server, also uses the new method of
    sending transactions to likely verifiers.
