<h1>Nyzo 600: incoming blocks</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 600
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/ca8cee6cf06ecc34224ab1af52d49232e2910a9d"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) implements selective processing of blocks sent in
    <span class="code">NewBlock9</span> messages.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects only the verifier. No other modes receive <span class="code">NewBlock9</span> messages.
</p>

<p>
    The changes in this version are due to a report by a member of the community. This member provided an explanation
    and script showing that it was easy to cause excess work for a verifier with large blocks on incoming
    <span class="code">NewBlock9</span> messages. We encourage the cycle to reward the report appropriately. The
    reporter provided the following address for receiving a bounty:
</p>

<ul>
    <li class="code">id__8aWfYfxxuM~VR-fIDGEMmjQvAYExcLfW90AWmnffEECZ_H-T~ZIp</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In <span class="code">MeshListener.response()</span>, incoming <span class="code">NewBlock9</span> content objects
    are now checked for proper type before processing. This does not affect behavior significantly, but it does avoid
    exceptions and null responses when the incoming block is not processed.
</p>

<p>
    A new constructor was added to <span class="code">Message</span>. This new constructor allows the
    <span class="code">valid</span> value to be specified instead of requiring its computation in the constructor.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message.fromBytes()</span>, the source-node identifier is now read before processing content.
    Note that integrity of the blacklist is preserved. While the signature is not verified before blacklisting, the
    blacklist indexes on IP address, and UDP messages are excluded from this process.
</p>

<p>
    The content of the message is now processed only when the message signature is valid. This also avoids processing of
    content when an invalid message type is sent from an out-of-cycle verifier. The pi&eacute;ce de r&egrave;sistance of
    these changes, though, is the extraction of the source-node identifier before processing of content, and the sending
    of that identifier to the <span class="code">processContent()</span> method.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">Message.processContent()</span> method now accepts the source-node identifier, and it now
    passes that identifier to the <span class="code">NewBlockMessage.fromByteBuffer()</span> method. As the
    <span class="code">fromByteBuffer()</span> methods are convention, not interface definitions, no further changes are
    required for this additional argument.

<p>
    In the <span class="code">ShortLong</span> class, a new static method was created to, essentially, deserialize a
    long value to a <span class="code">ShortLong</span> object. To reduce code duplication, this method is now used by
    the other static methods that build <span class="code">ShortLong</span> objects.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">NewBlockMessage</span>, restraint is now applied in processing the payload of the message.
    Before, all incoming blocks were processed. Now, all blocks with invalid heights are immediately excluded, and large
    blocks are only accepted from in-cycle verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">SignatureUtil</span>, an overload of <span class="code">signatureIsValid()</span> was added to
    allow validating signatures for signed data that does not fill an entire source array. This allows for signatures of
    incoming messages to be validated without creating copies of parts of the <span class="code">byte</span> arrays that
    contain the messages. The old overload of <span class="code">signatureIsValid()</span>, using the entire array of
    signed bytes, now passes through to the new overload.
