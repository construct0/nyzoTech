<h1>Nyzo 537: consensus improvements&thinsp;/&thinsp;v1 preparation</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 537
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/f132fa1a14d41ee60c01d143c9e3e19c1f4ba033"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) improves the consensus process and prepares for the transition from
    version 0 to version 1 of the blockchain.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version only modifies verifier behavior significantly. While the code involved also affects other run modes of
    Nyzo, only verifiers will benefit from upgrading to this version.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="emphasis">Please note that this version does not attempt to correct the memory-pressure issues that
        initially caused verifiers to become unresponsive and slow down cycle processing.</span> It does attempt to
    correct, from multiple angles, the stalls and ultimate one-block fork that caused so many verifiers and sentinels to
    fail. While slowdowns in block processing are undesirable, they are of little consequence as long as they do not
    lead to full stalls. These memory-pressure issues will be addressed in the near future.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">BalanceListManager</span> adds three fields: <span class="code">blockchainVersion</span>,
    <span class="code">unlockThreshold</span>, and <span class="code">unlockTransferSum</span>. The blockchain version
    is currently 0. The changes necessary to lock the block-1 wallets will move the blockchain to version 1.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_0.png" alt="RN_537 code 0" class="code-image" style="width: 480px;">

<p>
    Accessors have been added for the three new fields.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_1.png" alt="RN_537 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 240px;">

<p>
    So that the version can be used to guide further reading of the balance-list data structure, it has been placed as
    the very first field in the serialized binary structure. While this field was not actually present in the initial
    balance-list data structure, the layout of the serialized form allows us to pretend that it was present. The
    <span class="code">ShortLong</span> class is used to encapsulate this behavior. 2 bytes of the space initially
    allocated for block height have been reallocated to store the blockchain version. As these bytes were the
    most-significant bytes of the block height (representing the largest powers of 2 in the binary representation), they
    have all represented values of <span class="code">0</span> for all blocks produced so far, so this representation is
    naturally backward-compatible. The <span class="code">unlockThreshold</span> and
    <span class="code">unlockTransferSum</span> are at the end of the serialized data structure, and they are only read
    for version-1 or later balance lists.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_2.png" alt="RN_537 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    The changes to the serialization method mirror the changes to the deserialization method.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_3.png" alt="RN_537 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 350px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">cycleAccountIdentifier</span> has been added to <span class="code">BalanceListItem</span>.
    This location was chosen because the <span class="code">transferIdentifier</span> was already defined in this class.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_4.png" alt="RN_537 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 450px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BalanceManager</span>, the <span class="code">seedAccountIdentifier</span> has been exposed
    as a public variable. It was exposed to allow its use in a script to calculate total coins in circulation.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_5.png" alt="RN_537 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 450px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">approvedTransactionsForBlock()</span>, the balance list is fetched slightly earlier to allow
    its use in enforcing locked-wallet restrictions.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_6.png" alt="RN_537 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">enforceLockingRules()</span> method removes transactions that do not comply with the rules
    for locked accounts. In any block, if the sum of transactions from locked accounts exceeds the allowable amount,
    then all such transactions are removed from the block. <span class="emphasis">This logic is important. If it does
    not operate properly, we might be able to transfer coins out of these wallets more quickly than we should be able to
    transfer them.</span>
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_7.png" alt="RN_537 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 450px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">Block</span> class, constants have been added for
    <span class="code">minimumBlockchainVersion</span> and <span class="code">maximumBlockchainVersion</span>.
    Currently, the only supported blockchain version is <span class="code">0</span>, so it is both the minimum and
    maximum.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_8.png" alt="RN_537 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 460px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">blockchainVersion</span> field has been added to the <span class="code">Block</span> data
    structure, and all 3 constructors now require the blockchain version.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_9.png" alt="RN_537 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 475px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">limitBlockchainVersion()</span> method ensures that the blockchain version is always a
    version that this software knows how to process.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_10.png" alt="RN_537 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 450px;">

<p>
    An accessor has been added for blockchain version.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_11.png" alt="RN_537 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 200px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">getByteSize()</span>, <span class="code">FieldByteSize.blockHeight</span> has been replaced
    with <span class="code">FieldByteSize.combinedVersionAndHeight</span>. Both of these constants have a value of
    <span class="code">8</span>, but this change improves the readability of the code.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_12.png" alt="RN_537 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 390px;">

<p>
    In serialization of blocks, the space previously occupied by the height is now occupied by the combined version
    and height. This is the same pattern used for balance lists.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_13.png" alt="RN_537 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 350px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">getMinimumVoteTimestamp()</span>, two blocks are reserved specifically for new verifiers in
    each span of 50 blocks. In these blocks, a significant delay is added to voting for all current verifiers. The final
    block of the span, with a 40-second delay, will be used to allow sentinel broadcast of new-verifier blocks to
    mitigate denial-of-service attacks against verifiers trying to enter the cycle. The sentinel will be modified in
    the near future to complete this functionality.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_14.png" alt="RN_537 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    Deserialization of blocks also accounts for the new <span class="code">blockchainVersion</span> field.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_15.png" alt="RN_537 code 15" class="code-image" style="width: 480px;">

<p>
    The conditions in <span class="code">balanceListForNextBlock()</span> have been restructured to make the logic
    easier to follow. Also, the <span class="code">previousUnlockThreshold</span> and
    <span class="code">previousUnlockTransferSum</span> have been added and are calculated for blockchain version 1.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_16.png"
     alt="RN_537 code 16" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    In the vast majority of cases, the blockchain version will not change from one block to the next. The
    <span class="code">BlockchainVersionManager</span> will handle all transitions to higher-numbered blockchain
    versions. Currently, the blockchain version is always fetched from the previous balance list, which will keep the
    blockchain at version 0 until the upgrade is implemented. Also, the unlock threshold and transfer sum are obtained
    from the previous block. These are both cumulative values.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_17.png" alt="RN_537 code 17" class="code-image" style="width: 430px;">

<p>
    In the transaction loop that adjusts balances and determines block fees, separate sums of organic transaction fees
    and transactions from locked accounts are now calculated. The organic transaction fees will be added to the
    unlock threshold, and the transactions from locked accounts will be added to the transfer sum.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_18.png" alt="RN_537 code 18" class="code-image" style="width: 520px;">

<p>
    Transfer of some fees to the seed account will be implemented in another update. This update is being released with
    incomplete functionality for blockchain version 1. This is being done to allow more time for community code review
    before the changes take effect, and it is being done to allow for continued release of bug fixes.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_19.png" alt="RN_537 code 19" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    The version-1 account fee modifications have been implemented. This will eliminate account fees for most accounts
    while promoting faster removal of accounts with very low balances.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_20.png" alt="RN_537 code 20" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    For version 1 of the blockchain, the unlock threshold and transfer sum are accumulated. For version 0, they are both
    kept at 0.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_21.png" alt="RN_537 code 21" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    Two options have been added to <span class="code">BlockFileConsolidator</span>. These options will be implemented in
    a future version to allow operators of verifiers more choice in how storage and compute resources are utilized for
    maintaining historical blockchain data. While decentralized storage of a full history of the blockchain is
    important for the cycle as a whole, it is not necessarily important for each individual verifier to maintain a full
    history.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_22.png" alt="RN_537 code 22" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager</span>, <span class="code">lastVerifierJoinHeight</span> is now stored. This
    follows the same pattern as <span class="code">lastVerifierRemovalHeight</span>, and it is used to provide a rough
    idea of when the cycle might be accepting new verifiers.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_23.png" alt="RN_537 code 23" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.registerVote()</span>, better checking of the
    <span class="code">Message</span> argument has been added to avoid a null-pointer exception.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_24.png" alt="RN_537 code 24" class="code-image" style="width: 380px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlockchainVersionManager</span> will manage the upgrade from version 0 to version 1 of the
    blockchain. <span class="code">CycleTransactionManager</span> will track all proposed cycle transactions.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_25.png" alt="RN_537 code 25" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">FieldByteSize</span>, <span class="code">combinedVersionAndHeight</span> has been added to
    represent the combined space that blockchain version and block height now occupy in the serialized forms of blocks
    and balance lists.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_26.png" alt="RN_537 code 26" class="code-image" style="width: 290px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">LockedAccountManager</span> catalogs all accounts publicly known to be controlled by the Nyzo
    team. This includes the official Nyzo verifiers, some "anonymous" verifiers that have been mentioned on Discord,
    the Genesis account, and all block-1 distribution accounts. The comments in the code provide a more detailed
    explanation.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_27.png" alt="RN_537 code 27" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    To improve lookup efficiency, the locked accounts are stored in a <span class="code">Set</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_28.png" alt="RN_537 code 28" class="code-image" style="width: 400px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">main()</span> method of <span class="code">LockedAccountManager</span> is a script that
    provides information about Nyzo circulation at the local frozen edge.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_29.png" alt="RN_537 code 29" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    The script output appears as follows.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_30.png" alt="RN_537 code 30" class="code-image" style="width: 170px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">isSubjectToLock()</span> method indicates whether a transaction must comply with the locking
    rules in version 1 of the blockchain. Seed transactions are not subject to locking, and transactions to the cycle
    account are not subject to locking. All other transactions from locked accounts are subject to locking.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_31.png" alt="RN_537 code 31" class="code-image" style="width: 530px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">id()</span> method exists to make the hard-coded locked-account list more succinct.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_32.png" alt="RN_537 code 32" class="code-image" style="width: 480px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">maximum_conncurrent_connections_per_ip</span> can now be specified in the preferences file.
    This is a constant that we modified manually several times on the official Nyzo verifiers, and we are committed to
    running exactly the same code that we release to the community.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_33.png" alt="RN_537 code 33" class="code-image" style="width: 400px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">ShortLong</span> class provides structure for the blockchain version and block height for
    blocks and balance lists. For the blockchain version, it uses the top two bytes that were previously allocated to
    block height. This leaves 6 bytes for the block height, which still allows for over 60 million years of blocks.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_34.png" alt="RN_537 code 34" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">TestnetGenesisBlockCreator</span> now specifies a blockchain version of
    <span class="code">0</span> for the first block. We plan to test the upgrade from version 0 to version 1 on
    several testnets before its scheduled deployment on the production blockchain. Also, a multiplication by
    <span class="code">1L</span> has been eliminated to silence an IDE warning.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_35.png" alt="RN_537 code 35" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    Several modifications have been made to the <span class="code">Transaction</span> class to prepare for transactions
    from the cycle wallet. Cycle transactions will require a list of signatures &mdash; more than 75% of the current
    cycle &mdash; to be approved. Several other pieces still need to be implemented to support cycle transactions.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_36.png" alt="RN_537 code 36" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">signatureIsValid()</span> method has been modified to ensure that single signatures are only
    accepted for seed and standard transactions. This is not an actual security concern for the cycle wallet, as the
    0000...0002 wallet is obviously a wallet for which a private key is not available, but it is still a reasonable
    precaution to reduce the potential for problems if other multi-signature transactions are added in the future.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_37.png" alt="RN_537 code 37" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager</span>, the current vote is now persisted to disk. This ensures that the
    verifier will not cast an arbitrary vote when it restarts that contradicts a previous vote.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_38.png" alt="RN_537 code 38" class="code-image" style="width: 510px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">updateVote()</span> method, the <span class="code">newVoteBlock</span> variable has been
    eliminated. This variable was only used as a temporary store of the hash of the vote, and its use was confusing and
    unwieldy. Now, the hash of the vote is immediately stored in the <span class="code">newVoteHash</span> variable in
    all cases.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_39.png" alt="RN_537 code 39" class="code-image" style="width: 240px;">

<p>
    When this verifier does not yet have enough information to attempt to reach consensus, it now falls back to its
    previous vote before attempting to calculate a vote independently. Most of the time, this logic is totally
    unnecessary. If many verifiers restart while the blockchain is stalled, this will help to ensure that the verifiers
    do not inadvertently reach consensus on a new block when consensus has already been reached on a different block.
    While this is not the only safeguard that will be put in place in response to the recent consensus issues,
    <span class="emphasis">this safeguard, on its own, would have easily avoided the recent issues that caused so many
    verifiers to be dropped from the cycle.</span>
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_40.png" alt="RN_537 code 40" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    Whenever the vote changes, it is written to a file so that it will be available if the verifier restarts.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_41.png" alt="RN_537 code " class="code-image" style="width: 520px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Verifier</span>, a small block-vote-request process has been reintroduced. This old
    block-vote-request process was eliminated previously because it added significant additional strain to the cycle.
    This is a much lower-intensity process than the previous process, querying no more than 10 votes every 4 seconds.
    Block-vote requests are especially useful for one specific reason: if a group of verifiers have frozen a block
    and have moved on to working on the next block, they will no longer proactively send votes for the block that they
    think the cycle has already frozen. These requests allow the verifiers stuck on the previous block to re-involve
    the verifiers in the next block in the previous block's consensus process, giving the verifiers on the next block
    the opportunity to encourage the other verifiers to move forward to the correct block.
    <span class="emphasis">This safeguard, on its own, would also have avoided the recent issues that caused so many
    verifiers to be dropped from the cycle.</span> This vote-request process also helps to reestablish lost connections
    to verifiers that have suffered temporary outages, and it will enable faster recovery in many cases for verifiers
    that suffer tracking issues.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_42.png" alt="RN_537 code 42" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    The actual vote requests are made to random in-cycle verifiers. As the comment explains, this random process is less
    efficient than a targeted process would be, but it also provides a simple robustness that is desirable.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_43.png" alt="RN_537 code 43" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    Blocks are currently created with the same blockchain version as their predecessors. When
    <span class="code">BlockchainVersionManager</span> is complete, it will handle the transition from version 0 to
    version 1.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_44.png" alt="RN_537 code 44" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    The last join height is displayed just before the last removal height in the status response.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_45.png" alt="RN_537 code 45" class="code-image" style="width: 430px;">

<p>
    The sentinel does not attempt to upgrade the blockchain version, and it will never need to do so. This will be
    explained further when the upgrade process is fully implemented.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_46.png" alt="RN_537 code 46" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">ShortLongTest</span> stores and retrieves 40,000 combinations of values in
    <span class="code">ShortLong</span> objects to ensure no loss of information occurs due to this data structure.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_47.png" alt="RN_537 code 47" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    For backward compatibility with version-0 blocks, the <span class="code">ShortLong</span> encoding is also checked
    for equality against raw long values.
</p>

<img src="images/0537/rn_537_48.png" alt="RN_537 code 48" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    A new method for printing Nyzo amounts has been introduced to <span class="code">PrintUtil</span>. This method is
    used in the <span class="code">LockedAccountManager</span> script that shows how many coins are currently in
    circulation.
</p>
