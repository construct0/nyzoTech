<h1>Nyzo 592: temporary cycle closure (optional)</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 592
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/d861556fae17455233ee3cf667aef63340eaf69e"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) hard codes overrides to temporarily close the cycle to new entries. This
    is entirely optional.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the verifier.
</p>

<p>
    Cycle stalls are stressful and time-consuming for operators of verifiers. Our debugging of recent cycle stalls has
    revealed two problems, both of which have been fixed. However, the stalls continue to occur. We want to give the
    cycle a break from manually fixing cycle stalls, and we want some time to implement a thoughtful solution to the
    problem.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager</span>, the likelyAcceptingNewVerifiers() method is been hard-coded to always
    return <span class="code">false</span>. This prevents the artificial delays every 25 blocks that were introduced to
    give new verifiers extra time to join.

<p>
    The <span class="code">override</span> field in <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteManager</span> is now initialized
    to <span class="code">1000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000000</span>. This is an
    obviously invalid identifier. If enough verifiers vote for this identifier, the 50% threshold required to admit a
    new verifier will not be achieved.
