<h1>Nyzo 577: block delay for testing</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 577
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/2421596f929fb7115aaf4e5b5142b5f1ddaf2b39"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds an option to delay block production. This allows for safe testing of
    sentinel protection.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    The version affects the verifier only.
</p>

<p>
    Recent losses of cycle verifiers are likely due to sentinel failures. To help avoid such losses in the future, this
    version adds a safe method for testing sentinel block production. This will allow operators of verifiers to confirm
    that their sentinels are working properly and will provide an opportunity to correct any sentinel issues before
    outages arise that place verifiers in jeopardy.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Block</span>, the <span class="code">blockDelayHeight</span> field was added to implement the
    delay option. By default, this field has a value of <span class="code">-1</span>, which is inactive for all block
    heights.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Block.getMinimumVoteTimestamp()</span>, a 40-second offset is applied to blocks produced by
    this verifier when the delay option is active. This is long enough to allow a sentinel to provide coverage, and it
    is short enough to avoid any risk if the sentinel fails to provide coverage.
</p>

<p>
    An accessor and mutator are provided for <span class="code">blockDelayHeight</span>. The accessor is used by
    <span class="code">StatusResponse</span>, and the mutator does not take an argument. Instead, it sets the height one
    cycle past the current frozen edge. This will cause exactly one scheduled block by this verifier to be delayed.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">MeshListener.response()</span>, a <span class="code">BlockDelayResponse423</span> is produced
    in response to <span class="code">BlockDelayRequest422</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0577/rn_577_3.png" alt="RN_576 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 110px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message.processContent()</span>, processing of <span class="code">BlockDelayResponse</span>
    for <span class="code">MessageType.BlockDelayResponse423</span> was added.
</p>

<img src="images/0577/rn_577_4.png" alt="RN_576 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    Values <span class="code">BlockDelayRequest422</span> and <span class="code">BlockDelayResponse423</span> were added
    to the <span class="code">MessageType</span> enumeration.
</p>

<img src="images/0577/rn_577_5.png" alt="RN_576 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 220px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    The block-delay height, labeled as "<span class="code">sentinel test height</span>," was added to the private
    section of the <span class="code">StatusResponse</span>.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">BlockDelayResponse</span> is implemented as a subclass of
    <span class="code">BooleanMessageResponse</span> to eliminate the tedium of serialization and deserialization.
</p>

<p>
    If the delay request is accepted, <span class="code">Block.setBlockDelayHeight()</span> is called, activating the
    timing delay for the next cycle.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">BlockDelayRequestScript</span> sends a message to a verifier to activate the delay. The
    script requires two arguments, the IP address (or host name) and the private key.
</p>

<p>
    The following screenshot shows the script running on a Windows 10 system, activating the delay on
    <span class="verifier-name">Argo 746</span>.
</p>

<p>
    An earlier activation of this delay caused a sentinel to cover for <span class="verifier-name">Argo 746</span>,
    which resulted in sentinel block
    <a href="https://client.nyzo.co/transactionSearch?blockHeight=7119595&action=run" target="_blank">7119595</a>
    being incorporated into the blockchain.
