<h1>Nyzo 475: mesh reopening 1</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 475
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/f655b3e8dcef1e6931b78286583116ab9a53408b"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) is the first of two updates to allow the mesh to be reopened for new
    verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    Shortly after the launch of the Nyzo blockchain, interest in the project resulted in rapid growth of the list of
    verifiers waiting to join. The design of the Nyzo verifier software at this time caused the computational demands
    of in-cycle verifiers to grow proportionally to the size of the waiting-verifiers list, and the magnitude of that
    growth was such that it was causing an unacceptable burden on in-cycle verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    While the decentralized nature of Nyzo prevented us from truly closing the mesh to new verifiers, we were able to
    hide new verifiers from the nyzo.co website, and we were able to instruct the official Nyzo verifiers to ignore
    messages from verifiers that joined after a cutoff date. We were neither happy about nor proud of this solution, and
    some users figured out how to work around it, adding one or more lines to the
    <span class="code">trusted_entry_points</span> file to contact verifiers that the Nyzo team did not control.
</p>

<p>
    "Closing" the mesh did, however, reduce the rate at which new verifiers were started. This reduced rate gave us time
    to implement design improvements that effectively decoupled computational load of in-cycle verifiers from the size
    of the pool of verifiers waiting to join the cycle. This version, along with version 476, implement those
    improvements.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockFileConsolidator</span>, consolidation is no longer performed as soon as the last block
    in a 1000-block range is frozen. Instead, consolidation is performed when that block falls behind the retention
    edge. This was done to improve the efficiency of the initialization process when the verifier is restarted. Loading
    of blocks from individual files is more efficient than loading of blocks from consolidated files.

<p>
    Deletion of the individual file for the Genesis block was eliminated. This block will always be required by the
    <span class="code">BlockManager</span>.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager</span>, the <span class="code">verifierInCurrentCycle</span> set has been
    replaced with <span class="code">currentCycleList</span> and <span class="code">currentCycleSet</span>. The list is
    used when an ordered collection is needed, and the set is used when ordering is unimportant.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">currentCycleEndHeight</span> field stores the block height of the last element in
    <span class="code">currentCycleList</span>. The <span class="code">cycleComplete</span> field tracks whether the
    <span class="code">BlockManager</span> has been tracking the blockchain long enough to have full knowledge of the
    current cycle.
</p>

<p>
    A <span class="code">main()</span> method was added for testing the initialization process.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_3.png" alt="RN_475 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 210px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">getTrailingEdgeHeight()</span> accessor, recalculation of the trailing edge height is now
    performed if the current value is negative. This ensures that a valid value is returned as soon as sufficient block
    information is available.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_4.png" alt="RN_475 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 410px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">getRetentionEdgeHeight()</span> accessor, a value of <span class="code">-1</span> is now
    returned when the trailing edge height is <span class="code">-1</span>. This does not affect behavior, but it makes
    more sense than returning a value of <span class="code">-25</span> when the value cannot be calculated. Also, when
    the the trailing edge is close to <span class="code">0</span>, the retention edge is limited to no less than
    <span class="code">0</span>. This does not affect behavior, either, and is only to improve display.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_5.png" alt="RN_475 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 450px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">frozenBlockForHeight()</span>, the <span class="code">HistoricalBlockManagerMap</span>
    fallback was eliminated. Delivering blocks behind the retention edge was an unnecessary burden on verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    Two <span class="code">TODO</span> comments were removed after testing. Until
    <a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/a24f170884c05679e4634d7cc7bbb7e760273f65" target="_blank">
        commit a24f170884c05679e4634d7cc7bbb7e760273f65</a>, the Nyzo verifier did not have a
    <span class="code">BalanceListManager</span>, instead storing balance lists as properties on blocks. Introduction of
    the <span class="code">BalanceListManager</span> was necessary to control memory usage, but it required extensive
    testing to ensure that balance lists were available when they were needed for processing.
