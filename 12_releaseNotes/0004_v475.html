<h1>Nyzo 475: mesh reopening 1</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 475
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/f655b3e8dcef1e6931b78286583116ab9a53408b"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) is the first of two updates to allow the mesh to be reopened for new
    verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    Shortly after the launch of the Nyzo blockchain, interest in the project resulted in rapid growth of the list of
    verifiers waiting to join. The design of the Nyzo verifier software at this time caused the computational demands
    of in-cycle verifiers to grow proportionally to the size of the waiting-verifiers list, and the magnitude of that
    growth was such that it was causing an unacceptable burden on in-cycle verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    While the decentralized nature of Nyzo prevented us from truly closing the mesh to new verifiers, we were able to
    hide new verifiers from the nyzo.co website, and we were able to instruct the official Nyzo verifiers to ignore
    messages from verifiers that joined after a cutoff date. We were neither happy about nor proud of this solution, and
    some users figured out how to work around it, adding one or more lines to the
    <span class="code">trusted_entry_points</span> file to contact verifiers that the Nyzo team did not control.
</p>

<p>
    "Closing" the mesh did, however, reduce the rate at which new verifiers were started. This reduced rate gave us time
    to implement design improvements that effectively decoupled computational load of in-cycle verifiers from the size
    of the pool of verifiers waiting to join the cycle. This version, along with version 476, implement those
    improvements.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockFileConsolidator</span>, consolidation is no longer performed as soon as the last block
    in a 1000-block range is frozen. Instead, consolidation is performed when that block falls behind the retention
    edge. This was done to improve the efficiency of the initialization process when the verifier is restarted. Loading
    of blocks from individual files is more efficient than loading of blocks from consolidated files.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_0.png" alt="RN_475 code 0" class="code-image" style="width: 450px;">

<p>
    Deletion of the individual file for the Genesis block was eliminated. This block will always be required by the
    <span class="code">BlockManager</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_1.png" alt="RN_475 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 450px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager</span>, the <span class="code">verifierInCurrentCycle</span> set has been
    replaced with <span class="code">currentCycleList</span> and <span class="code">currentCycleSet</span>. The list is
    used when an ordered collection is needed, and the set is used when ordering is unimportant.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">currentCycleEndHeight</span> field stores the block height of the last element in
    <span class="code">currentCycleList</span>. The <span class="code">cycleComplete</span> field tracks whether the
    <span class="code">BlockManager</span> has been tracking the blockchain long enough to have full knowledge of the
    current cycle.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_2.png" alt="RN_475 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 340px;">

<p>
    A <span class="code">main()</span> method was added for testing the initialization process.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_3.png" alt="RN_475 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 210px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">getTrailingEdgeHeight()</span> accessor, recalculation of the trailing edge height is now
    performed if the current value is negative. This ensures that a valid value is returned as soon as sufficient block
    information is available.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_4.png" alt="RN_475 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 410px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">getRetentionEdgeHeight()</span> accessor, a value of <span class="code">-1</span> is now
    returned when the trailing edge height is <span class="code">-1</span>. This does not affect behavior, but it makes
    more sense than returning a value of <span class="code">-25</span> when the value cannot be calculated. Also, when
    the the trailing edge is close to <span class="code">0</span>, the retention edge is limited to no less than
    <span class="code">0</span>. This does not affect behavior, either, and is only to improve display.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_5.png" alt="RN_475 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 450px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">frozenBlockForHeight()</span>, the <span class="code">HistoricalBlockManagerMap</span>
    fallback was eliminated. Delivering blocks behind the retention edge was an unnecessary burden on verifiers.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_6.png" alt="RN_475 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 370px;">

<p>
    Two <span class="code">TODO</span> comments were removed after testing. Until
    <a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/a24f170884c05679e4634d7cc7bbb7e760273f65" target="_blank">
        commit a24f170884c05679e4634d7cc7bbb7e760273f65</a>, the Nyzo verifier did not have a
    <span class="code">BalanceListManager</span>, instead storing balance lists as properties on blocks. Introduction of
    the <span class="code">BalanceListManager</span> was necessary to control memory usage, but it required extensive
    testing to ensure that balance lists were available when they were needed for processing.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_7.png" alt="RN_475 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 390px;">

<p>
    The one-argument overload of <span class="code">BlockManager.freezeBlock()</span> retrieves the previous block and
    passes information about it to the other overload of the method. This other overload now accepts another argument,
    the list of cycle verifiers, and the one-argument method provides a <span class="code">null</span> value for this.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_8.png" alt="RN_475 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 360px;">

<p>
    The three-argument overload of <span class="code">BlockManager.freezeBlock()</span> was modified to accept four
    arguments. The new argument, <span class="code">cycleVerifiers</span>, is used in some cases as a lightweight
    alternative to allow the verifier to know the membership the current cycle when it would otherwise be unable due to
    a short time tracking the blockchain.
</p>

<p>
    Two notifications were removed from this method, also.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_9.png" alt="RN_475 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 440px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager.loadBlockFromFile()</span>, blocks are no longer loaded from consolidated files.
    Loading blocks from individual files is much more efficient than loading blocks from consolidated files. When a
    single block from a file is needed, many more from the same file are typically needed. So, when a single block is
    needed from a consolidated file, the entire file is extracted, and the block is loaded from the individual file.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_10.png" alt="RN_475 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 450px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager.initialize()</span>, a check was added to prevent entry into the initialization
    code if initialization has already completed. This causes the diff to show substantial changes due to indentation
    differences.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_11.png" alt="RN_475 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 220px;">

<p>
    Further into the method, there are more indentation changes, and loading of blocks from consolidated files has been
    eliminated.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_12.png" alt="RN_475 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 240px;">

<p>
    Blocks are loaded from individual files as before. To attempt to have cycle information available as often as
    possible, blocks are loaded behind the frozen edge until the cycle information for the frozen edge can be calculated
    or until a missing block is encountered.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_13.png" alt="RN_475 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 330px;">

<p>
    Loading of blocks between the trailing edge and frozen edge has been eliminated, replaced with the loading of blocks
    starting at the frozen edge and stepping backward, described above. The remaining changes in the method are
    indentation differences due to the <span class="code">!initialized</span> condition now wrapping the entire method.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_14.png" alt="RN_475 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 460px; max-height: 330px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">BlockManager.loadBalanceListFromFileForHeight()</span> method now extracts consolidated
    files if their contents are needed. The updated consolidation logic should prevent blocks from ever needing to be
    used after consolidation, but this extraction pattern for blocks and balance lists assures elimination of
    performance issues due to loading data from consolidated files.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_15.png" alt="RN_475 code 15" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">BlockManager.extractConsolidatedFile()</span> method produces individual block files from
    consolidated block files. This is roughly the inverse of the function of the
    <span class="code">BlockFileConsolidator</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_16.png" alt="RN_475 code 16" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 500px;">

<p>
    As blocks are no longer read directly from consolidated files, the
    <span class="code">BlockManager.findHighestConsolidatedFileStartHeight()</span> method is no longer needed.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_17.png" alt="RN_475 code 17" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 380px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlockManager.setFrozenEdge()</span> now accepts a list of cycle verifiers as its second argument.
    This is a backup for situations when the list of verifiers cannot be calculated from available blocks. The list is
    passed to the <span class="code">updateVerifiersInCurrentCycle()</span> method for the calculation.
</p>

<p>
    Also, the <span class="code">trailingEdgeHeight</span> is now set to <span class="code">-1L</span> whenever the
    frozen edge's cycle information is not available.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_18.png" alt="RN_475 code 18" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 200px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">currentCycleList</span> replaces the <span class="code">currentCycleLength</span> field as
    the source of the value for the <span class="code">currentCycleLength()</span> method.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_19.png" alt="RN_475 code 19" class="code-image" style="width: 200px; max-height: 50px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">BlockManager.verifiersInCurrentCycleList()</span> method provides the identifiers of the
    verifiers in the current cycle in an ordered list. The
    <span class="code">BlockManager.verifiersInCurrentCycleSet()</span> method, a renaming of
    <span class="code">BlockManager.verifiersInCurrentCycle()</span>, returns the same information as an unordered set.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_20.png" alt="RN_475 code 20" class="code-image" style="width: 320px; max-height: 110px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">BlockManager.verifierInCurrentCycle()</span> method uses the set that was renamed from
    <span class="code">verifiersInCurrentCycle</span> to <span class="code">currentCycleSet</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_21.png" alt="RN_475 code 21" class="code-image" style="width: 350px; max-height: 60px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">BlockManager.updateVerifiersInCurrentCycle()</span> method now accepts the supplemental
    <span class="code">bootstrapCycleVerifiers</span> argument. This list of cycle verifiers, provided by
    <span class="code">BootstrapResponseV2</span>, can be used by a verifier in the absence of sufficient block history
    to know what verifiers are in the current cycle.
</p>

<p>
    The first part of this method attempts to determine the verifiers in the current cycle through examination of
    blocks.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_22.png" alt="RN_475 code 22" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 320px;">

<p>
    If the standard (block-based) calculation of cycle verifiers was unsuccessful, an alternate calculation using either
    the <span class="code">BlockManager.currentCycleList</span> or <span class="code">bootstrapCycleVerifiers</span> is
    performed instead.
</p>

<p>
    If either of the calculations succeeds, the values are stored in the class fields.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_23.png" alt="RN_475 code 23" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 420px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockVoteManager</span>, a <span class="code">minimumVoteInterval</span> was added to limit
    the rate at which votes are flipped. A receipt timestamp is stored on votes to ensure that enforcement is based on
    local timestamps, not on timestamps set by the sender. If the interval between receipt timestamps of votes is less
    than the specified minimum, the vote is discarded.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_24.png" alt="RN_475 code 24" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 300px;">

<p>
    When retrieving the <span class="code">verifiersInCurrentCycle</span> from <span class="code">BlockManager</span>,
    the updated method name is used.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_25.png" alt="RN_475 code 25" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 65px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">ChainInitializationManager</span> no longer uses the
    <span class="code">BootstrapVoteTally</span> class, so it was deleted.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_26.png" alt="RN_475 code 26" class="code-image" style="width: 340px; max-height: 410px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">ChainInitializationManager</span>, the <span class="code">hashVotes</span> map, which stored
    <span class="code">BootstrapVoteTally</span> objects keyed on height, has been replaced with the
    <span class="code">bootstrapResponses</span> map, which stores <span class="code">BootstrapResponseV2</span> objects
    keyed on verifier identifier.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">ChainInitializationManager.processBootstrapResponseMessage()</span> method previously
    retrieved and modified <span class="code">BootstrapVoteTally</span> objects based on the bootstrap response. Now, it
    stores the <span class="code">BootstrapResponseV2</span> in a map, using the verifier's identifier as the key.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_27.png" alt="RN_475 code 27" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 250px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">ChainInitializationManager.frozenEdgeHeight()</span> method was replaced with
    <span class="code">ChainInitializationManager.winningResponse()</span>. The old method provided a hash and height
    derived from the <span class="code">BootstrapVoteTally</span> objects in the <span class="code">hashVotes</span>
    map. The new method performs a count of <span class="code">BootstrapResponseV2</span> objects in the
    <span class="code">bootstrapResponses</span> map. The <span class="code">BootstrapResponseV2</span> object contains
    both the hash and height of the frozen edge, like the previous result. It also provides the list of cycle verifiers
    used by the <span class="code">BlockManager</span> in the alternate cycle calculation.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_28.png" alt="RN_475 code 28" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 420px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">ChainInitializationManager.fetchChainSection()</span> method was replaced with
    <span class="code">ChainInitializationManager.fetchBlock()</span>. The new method only needs to fetch a single block
    and balance list. This, combined with the list of cycle verifiers from the
    <span class="code">BootstrapResponseV2</span>, allows a verifier to start tracking the blockchain. The request is
    performed in a loop that continues until a valid block and balance list are available.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_29.png" alt="RN_475 code 29" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 340px;">

<p>
    When the <span class="code">BlockResponse</span> is received in the <span class="code">fetchBlock()</span> method,
    its block is checked against the winning bootstrap response to ensure the correct block was sent.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_30.png" alt="RN_475 code 30" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 420px;">

<p>
    The method waits up to 5 seconds for the response to the block request.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_31.png" alt="RN_475 code 31" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 360px;">

<p>
    If a good response was received, the block is frozen. The list of cycle verifiers from the bootstrap response is
    also provided to the <span class="code">freezeBlock()</span> method.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_32.png" alt="RN_475 code 32" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 180px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">MeshListener.start()</span>, an error is now printed and
    <span class="code">UpdateUtil.terminate()</span> is called if an exception is thrown.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_33.png" alt="RN_475 code 33" class="code-image" style="width: 380px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">MeshListener.response()</span>, the response to the
    <span class="code">BootstrapRequest1</span> message was removed. Responding to this message was a considerable
    burden and a large part of why temporary closure of the mesh was necessary.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_34.png" alt="RN_475 code 34" class="code-image" style="width: 390px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    Later in <span class="code">MeshListener.response()</span>, the call to
    <span class="code">NodeManager.updateNode()</span> was removed from the process of responding to
    <span class="code">MessageType.NewBlock9</span> messages. This call was initially added to help keep information
    about the cycle current. It is being removed to prepare for introduction of the sentinel.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_35.png" alt="RN_475 code 35" class="code-image" style="width: 350px; max-height: 70px;">

<p>
    A response to <span class="code">BootstrapRequestV2_35</span> was added to replace
    <span class="code">BootstrapRequest1</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_36.png" alt="RN_475 code 36" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    A response to the private <span class="code">NewVerifierTallyStatusRequest414</span> message was added. The response
    provides the verifier's tally of votes from the <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteManager</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_37.png" alt="RN_475 code 37" class="code-image" style="width: 360px; max-height: 70px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">Message.broadcast()</span> method previously sent messages to all nodes. This design allowed
    out-of-cycle nodes to follow the consensus process and track the blockchain just as in-cycle nodes could. However,
    this was too much of a burden on in-cycle nodes as the list of out-of-cycle nodes grew. While the cycle grows at a
    strictly controlled rate, out-of-cycle nodes can be added as quickly as operators choose to start them.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">broadcast()</span> method was modified to only send messages to in-cycle nodes and a small
    number of out-of-cycle verifiers at the top of the voting list.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_38.png" alt="RN_475 code 38" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 140px;">

<p>
    To further reduce the burden on in-cycle verifiers, if a <span class="code">BlockVote19</span> message is received
    from an out-of-cycle verifier, a response is no longer provided.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_39.png" alt="RN_475 code 39" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 170px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message.processContent()</span>, conditions for <span class="code">BootstrapRequest1</span>
    and <span class="code">BootstrapResponse2</span> were removed. Conditions for
    <span class="code">BootstrapRequestV2_35</span>, <span class="code">BootstrapResponseV2_36</span>, and
    <span class="code">NewVerifierTallyStatusResponse415</span> were added.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_40.png" alt="RN_475 code 40" class="code-image" style="width: 350px; max-height: 320px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">MessageQueue</span>, three static fields were added. The
    <span class="code">shouldPrintZeroOnRemoval</span> field is used to avoid showing that the message queue emptied
    unless its size was significantly large. The <span class="code">inBadState</span> field marks when the
    <span class="code">MessageQueue</span> is suspected to be stalled. The <span class="code">lastMessageStatus</span>
    field is used in conjunction with <span class="code">inBadState</span> to try to help diagnose problems with the
    queue.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_41.png" alt="RN_475 code 41" class="code-image" style="width: 290px; max-height: 50px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">MessageQueue.blockThisThreadUntilClear()</span> method sleeps on the calling thread until the
    queue has cleared. If the <span class="code">MessageQueue</span> is filled with messages faster than those messages
    can be removed, message-processing time increases and the system stops functioning properly. This method is called
    before sending new messages to avoid clogging the queue.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_42.png" alt="RN_475 code 42" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 280px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">MessageQueue.add()</span>, print statements were added to periodically show as the queue grows
    in size. If the queue passes a certain size, the <span class="code">shouldPrintZeroOnRemoval</span> field is set to
    <span class="code">true</span> so another message will be shown when the queue empties.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_43.png" alt="RN_475 code 43" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 130px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">MessageQueue.next()</span>, print statements were added to show status as the queue shrinks in
    size.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_44.png" alt="RN_475 code 44" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 160px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">MessageQueue.start()</span>, statements were added to provide insight into queue stalls. The
    <span class="code">lastMessageStatus</span> field is set in this method to indicate the last processing state the
    queue tried to perform.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_45.png" alt="RN_475 code 45" class="code-image" style="width: 390px; max-height: 340px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">MessageType</span> enumeration, values were added for the bootstrap version 2 and
    new-verifier tally messages. The values for the version-1 bootstrap messages were removed.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_46.png" alt="RN_475 code 46" class="code-image" style="width: 290px; max-height: 280px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">NewVerifierQueueManager.updateVote()</span>, a condition was added to only update the vote if
    this verifier is in cycle.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_47.png" alt="RN_475 code 47" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 110px;">

<p>
    A method call in <span class="code">NewVerifierQueueManager.calculateVote()</span> was updated for the renamed
    <span class="code">BlockManager.verifiersInCurrentCycleSet()</span> method.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_48.png" alt="RN_475 code 48" class="code-image" style="width: 370px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    A method call in <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteManager.removeOldVotes()</span> was also updated for the renamed
    <span class="code">BlockManager.verifiersInCurrentCycleSet()</span> method.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_49.png" alt="RN_475 code 49" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 130px;">

<p>
    Creation of the vote-count map was encapsulated in the <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteManager.voteTotals()</span>
    method. This allows the logic, which was previously inline in the
    <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteManager.topVerifiers()</span> method, to be reused by the
    <span class="code">NewVerifierTallyStatusResponse</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_50.png" alt="RN_475 code 50" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 200px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteManager.topVerifiers()</span> method has been modified to use the
    <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteManager.voteTotals()</span> method and the renamed
    <span class="code">BlockManager.verifiersInCurrentCycleSet()</span> method.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_51.png" alt="RN_475 code 51" class="code-image" style="width: 460px; max-height: 410px;">

<p>
    At the end of <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteManager.topVerifiers()</span>, setting of the
    <span class="code">top new</span> field on the status response was eliminated. The
    <span class="code">NewVerifierTallyStatusResponse</span> provides a detailed look into the vote tally, so this field
    is no longer needed.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_52.png" alt="RN_475 code 52" class="code-image" style="width: 300px; max-height: 40px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">NodeManager</span>, the <span class="code">nodeJoinRequestTimestamps</span> map was added to
    limit the frequency at which node-join messages are sent to other nodes.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_53.png" alt="RN_475 code 53" class="code-image" style="width: 340px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">NodeManager.updateNode()</span>, the types of messages registered were reduced in preparation
    for the sentinel.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_54.png" alt="RN_475 code 54" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 110px;">

<p>
    Using the <span class="code">nodeJoinRequestTimestamps</span> map, a minimum interval of 60 seconds between messages
    to each node is now imposed in <span class="code">NodeManager.sendNodeJoinMessage()</span>. Most of the differences
    in this method are due to indentation changes.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_55.png" alt="RN_475 code 55" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 580px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager</span>, the <span class="code">disconnectedBlocks</span> map was added to
    allow a verifier to store blocks past the frozen edge when they cannot yet be registered normally. The
    <span class="code">lastBlockVoteTimestamp</span> is used to ensure that this verifier does not change its vote more
    frequently than is allowed by the minimum vote interval. The
    <span class="code">attemptToRegisterDisconnectedBlocks()</span> method tries to register blocks from the
    <span class="code">disconnectedBlocks</span> map into the primary map.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_56.png" alt="RN_475 code 56" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 220px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.registerBlock()</span>, blocks more than one past the frozen edge for
    which a balance list cannot be derived are added to the <span class="code">disconnectedBlocks</span> map.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_57.png" alt="RN_475 code 57" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 190px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.minimumVoteInterval</span> is enforced in
    <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.updateVote()</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_58.png" alt="RN_475 code 58" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 130px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.castVote()</span>, the <span class="code">lastBlockVoteTimestamp</span>
    is set to help enforce the minimum vote interval. Votes are now only broadcast from in-cycle verifiers and during
    the Genesis cycle, when all verifiers are considered in-cycle.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_59.png" alt="RN_475 code 59" class="code-image" style="width: 370px; max-height: 150px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.attemptToFreezeBlock()</span>, the
    <span class="code">lastBlockVoteTimestamp</span> is reset to <span class="code">0</span> when a block is frozen.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_60.png" alt="RN_475 code 60" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 130px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.fetchMissingBlock()</span>, a message was added to indicate receipt of a
    block response.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_61.png" alt="RN_475 code 61" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 150px;">

<p>
    To reduce network traffic, in <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.requestMissingBlocks()</span>, requests are
    now limited to only the height one past the local frozen edge.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_62.png" alt="RN_475 code 62" class="code-image" style="width: 390px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">static</span> block of <span class="code">Verifier</span>, printing of the verifier's
    identifier was added after loading of the private seed. This allows the operator to ensure that the seed was read
    properly.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_63.png" alt="RN_475 code 63" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    To eliminate any possible concerns of odd behavior due to multiple concurrent accesses, the
    <span class="code">Verifier.loadPrivateSeed()</span> method is now synchronized.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_64.png" alt="RN_475 code 64" class="code-image" style="width: 250px; max-height: 40px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Verifier.start()</span>, starting of the <span class="code">MeshListener</span> was moved
    earlier in the process to allow the verifier to start receiving messages sooner. Several print statements were added
    to allow an operator to observe initialization progress.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_65.png" alt="RN_475 code 65" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 400px;">

<p>
    Later in the <span class="code">Verifier.start()</span> method, sending of the old bootstrap messages was removed,
    and a condition was added to bypass the bootstrap process completely after restarts with obviously short downtime.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_66.png" alt="RN_475 code 66" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 310px;">

<p>
    The new bootstrap process uses the new <span class="code">BootstrapRequestV2_35</span> message. It also uses the
    <span class="code">MessageQueue.blockThisThreadUntilClear()</span> method to avoid backing up the queue, and the
    <span class="code">processBootstrapResponseMessage()</span> method is now encapsulated in
    <span class="code">ChainInitializationManager</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_67.png" alt="RN_475 code 67" class="code-image" style="width: 470px; max-height: 440px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">ChainInitializationManager.winningResponse()</span> provides the consensus
    <span class="code">BootstrapResponseV2</span> object, which encapsulates the height, hash, and cycle list of the
    consensus frozen edge.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_68.png" alt="RN_475 code 68" class="code-image" style="width: 460px; max-height: 230px;">

<p>
    If a consensus bootstrap response is determined, the verifier considers its own current state and its distance from
    this consensus response to determine whether the frozen edge should be reinitialized or the local state should be
    kept.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_69.png" alt="RN_475 code 69" class="code-image" style="width: 460px; max-height: 210px;">

<p>
    Premature termination of the verifier was eliminated. The new bootstrap process will not reach this point without
    satisfactory initialization. This code diff appears more substantial than it is due to indentation changes.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_70.png" alt="RN_475 code 70" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 360px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Verifier.loadGenesisBlock()</span>, a <span class="code">null</span> argument was added to the
    <span class="code">BlockManager.freezeBlock()</span> method call. This argument is for the new list of cycle
    verifiers provided by the bootstrap response, and it is irrelevant for the Genesis block.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_71.png" alt="RN_475 code 71" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 50px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">Verifier.processBootstrapResponseMessage()</span> method, which processed the original
    bootstrap responses, was removed. An equivalent method was added to
    <span class="code">ChainInitializationManager</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_72.png" alt="RN_475 code 72" class="code-image" style="width: 390px; max-height: 200px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Verifier.verifierMain()</span>, a call to
    <span class="code">MessageQueue.blockThisThreadUntilClear()</span> was added at the beginning of the loop to avoid
    backing up the <span class="code">MessageQueue</span>. A dead block of code related to reinitialization after an IP
    address change was removed. Before attempting to freeze a block, an attempt is now made to register disconnected
    blocks.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_73.png" alt="RN_475 code 73" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 290px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">BlockResponse</span> constructor, responses are now limited to 10 blocks or fewer, but the
    maximum size of the response was raised from 50,000 bytes to 1,000,000 bytes.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_74.png" alt="RN_475 code 74" class="code-image" style="width: 390px; max-height: 390px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockVote</span>, the <span class="code">receiptTimestamp</span> field was added to ensure a
    minimum time interval between block votes from a verifier.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_75.png" alt="RN_475 code 75" class="code-image" style="width: 390px; max-height: 240px;">

<p>
    The entire <span class="code">BootstrapResponse</span> class was deleted. The image below only shows the beginning
    of the class, but the entire class was removed.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_76.png" alt="RN_475 code 76" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 360px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">BootstrapResponseV2</span> class replaces the <span class="code">BootstrapResponse</span>
    class. It encapsulates a height for the frozen edge, a hash for the frozen edge, and a list of identifiers of
    verifiers in the current cycle.
</p>

<p>
    The no-argument constructor populates the object with values representing the current state of the verifier. It is
    used for responding to requests. The three-argument constructor populates the object with the argument values. It is
    used for reconstructing responses from other verifiers.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_77.png" alt="RN_475 code 77" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 190px;">

<p>
    Accessors are provided for all fields of <span class="code">BootstrapResponseV2</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_78.png" alt="RN_475 code 78" class="code-image" style="width: 200px; max-height: 110px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">BootstrapResponseV2.getByteSize()</span> and
    <span class="code">BootstrapResponseV2.getBytes()</span> methods are implemented as would be expected for this
    class. All fields are serialized.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_79.png" alt="RN_475 code 79" class="code-image" style="width: 350px; max-height: 240px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">BootstrapResponseV2.fromByteBuffer()</span> method is similarly predictable. It reads all the
    fields from a <span class="code">ByteBuffer</span> and returns a <span class="code">BootstrapResponseV2</span>
    object containing the values.
</p>

<img src="images/0475/rn_475_80.png" alt="RN_475 code 80" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 220px;">
