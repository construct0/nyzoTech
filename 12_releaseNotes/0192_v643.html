        target="_blank">commits on construct0's GitHub</a>) introduces a bugfix to the <span class="code-mb">PreferencesUtil</span> class, a bugfix to the <span class="code-mb">Verifier</span> class, an upgrade to gradle 8.4, the introduction of a subversion to the <span class="code-mb">Version</span> class and its references, <a href="https://github.com/construct0/nyzoVerifier/tags" target="_blank">introduction of git version tags for versions 642 and above</a>, and a switch in license to the Apache 2.0 license within <a href="https://github.com/construct0/nyzoVerifier/" target="_blank">construct0's nyzoVerifier repository</a>.
</p>

<pre class="emphasis">
    This version affects all run modes.
    
    This version spans across multiple commits, when in doubt use the git version tags as guidance.
    
    Version 643.2 concludes the final subversion of this version.
</pre>

<h3>PreferencesUtil bugfix</h3>

<p>
 The setup intructions pertaining to the preferences mention the usage of "true" and "false" for boolean values - this however did not work before (0 and 1 did), and usage of the string variants may have lead to misconfigured instances due to the missing checks.

<h3>Verifier connectivity, temporary threshold adjustment</h3>

<p>
 It was observed that in-cycle nodes were incapable of being able to be properly connected with the rest of the cycle after a reboot or reload of the running <span class="code-mb">nyzo_verifier</span> instance. 
 <br/><br/>
 This meant these nodes were unable to vote for or produce blocks while in this state.
 <br/><br/>
 This update temporarily sets the threshold to 51% + 1 node instead of the previous 75%.
 As is noted in the in-line documentation, this does not imply proper automatic consensus, but it allows for a properly connected and thus block (vote) producing verifier.
 <br/><br/>
 Thanks to EggPool for reporting this and suggesting a fix.

<h3>Gradle upgrade to version 8.4</h3>

<pre>
 To make development using Visual Studio Code tooling possible, gradle was upgraded to version 8.4.

 This upgrade does not change the way you build the source code using existing scripts.

<h3>Introduction of subversion</h3>

<p>
 Inspired by the <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank">Semantic Versioning</a> methodology a subversion was introduced, allowing for versions to be released using a Major and a Minor version. 
 <br/><br/>
 This version's final subversion is 2, making it v643.2.
 <br/><br/>
 All references where the Version class is used were updated as well.

<h3>Introduction of git repository version tags</h3>

<p>
 To ease cloning or pulling a specific version to your machine, and in conjunction with the subversion addition, version tags were introduced to the construct0 nyzoVerifier repository for versions 642 and above.
</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Switch to Apache 2.0 License</h3>
<p>
Due to legal ambiguities surrounding the previous the Unlicense license and to provide ease of mind for developers within the European Union, the license was switched to the Apache 2.0 license.
<br/><br/>
 As a sidenote, this license is more common than the MIT license on GitHub and should cover all bases in terms of a proper license.
