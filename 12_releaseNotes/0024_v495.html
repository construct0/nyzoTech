<h1>Nyzo 495: mesh listener stability</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 495
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/90f35149068b3889e9e358b449d2fa8d5f878905"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) improves the stability of the verifier through improvements to the mesh
    listener.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version does not affect the sentinel, as the sentinel does not use the <span class="code">MeshListener</span>
    class.
</p>

<p>
    Previously, the <span class="code">MeshListener</span> class was especially lenient with incoming connections. This
    leniency made it unnecessarily easy to keep many connections to a verifier open, which could allow an attacker to
    disable a verifier. This version enforces a maximum amount of time that a verifier will devote to a single
    connection, and it also enforces a maximum concurrent number of connections that a verifier will accept from a
    single source.
</p>

<p>
    All changes in this version are in the <span class="code">MeshListener</span> class. At the top of this class, the
    variables that track the number of messages rejected and accepted have been changed to
    <span class="code">AtomicLong</span> to eliminate potential concurrency issues. Also, a constant to define the
    maximum number of concurrent connections from a single IP has been added.
</p>

<p>
    In testing, a value of <span class="code">3</span> maximum concurrent connections per IP was sufficient to allow
    all normal verifier behavior, so the current maximum, <span class="code">6</span>, is twice the number of
    concurrent connections we would expect to see from a verifier operating normally. In the future, we will likely
    modify the <span class="code">Message</span> class to strictly limit the number of concurrent outgoing connections
    to a single IP, which will allow this incoming maximum to be adjusted downward without penalizing verifiers that
    are attempting to behave properly.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">BiFunction</span> interface is relatively new to Java, introduced in Java 1.8. This
    implementation of the interface will be used later by the map that tracks the number of connections from each IP,
    providing a simple sum of the counts if a merge is necessary. This merging behavior provides atomicity for the
    process of checking for existence of an item in a map and creating and adding it if it is not already present.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">start()</span> method, a <span class="code">Map</span> has been added to track the number
    of connections per IP, and an <span class="code">AtomicInteger</span> has been added to track the number of active
    threads. The number of active threads was initially intended only for testing, but it was found to be useful for
    performing cleanup on the map, so it was retained in the code.
</p>

<p>
    Previously, when a connection was accepted, the <span class="code">readMessageAndRespond()</span> method would be
    invoked as long as the source IP was not blacklisted. The logic has gotten slightly more complicated in this
    version, so processing of the socket has been moved into the new <span class="code">processSocket()</span> method.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">processSocket()</span>, blacklisting is handled first, as in the previous version. If
    <span class="code">iptables</span> is being used, blacklisted IPs will be rejected outside the application, but
    this ensures quick rejection of blacklisted connections if <span class="code">iptables</span> is not being used.
</p>

<p>
    For connections from IPs not yet blacklisted, the number of active connections from the IP is checked. If the
    new connection causes the count to exceed the maximum, the connection is immediately closed and the IP is added to
    the blacklist.
</p>

<img src="images/0495/rn_495_5.png" alt="RN_495 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 512px;">

<p>
    At this point, it is worth noting that in-cycle verifiers are removed from the blacklist in a maintenance operation
    that is performed after each block is frozen. So, if an in-cycle verifier happens to trigger this new protection,
    the effect will be temporary.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, a thread is started, as in the previous version, to read the message and respond to it. In this version,
    the <span class="code">setSoTimeout()</span> method is invoked on the socket to ensure that reads do not block for
    more than 300 milliseconds. This ensures that no single connection uses an unreasonable share of resources.
</p>

<p>
    When the number of active connections falls to zero, the <span class="code">connectionsPerIp</span> map is
    cleared to avoid long-term storage of many zero values.
