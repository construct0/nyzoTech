<h1>Release notes</h1>

<p>
    This section contains release notes for all versions 471 and above. Version 470 was the first public
    release version. Version 471 was the first update after public release.
</p>

<p>
    Release notes are integral to the Nyzo development process. Every commit to the Nyzo verifier repository is now
    uniquely numbered, and release notes are now published in tandem with every commit.
</p>

<p>
    With rare exceptions that are explained, release notes now contain screenshots of every code change except for
    import statements, and a simple description of every logic change is included.
</p>

<p>
    The release notes are intended to improve democratization through better community understanding of the code,
    improve security through more transparent detailing of logic modifications, and improve code quality by forcing the
    Nyzo team to review and explain every line of code before it is released publicly.
