<h1>Nyzo 530: Micropay</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 530
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/8adece0c08dff463320302577df0ab1e11d4453d"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds the Micropay server and client.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version adds two new run modes: the Micropay server and the Micropay client. It also affects the command-line
    client.
</p>

<p>
    This is a large commit, but the changes are all in systems that interact externally with the verifiers. The internal
    workings of the verifier and the sentinel are unaffected, so this version does not introduce any new concerns
    regarding the security or efficiency of blockchain processing.
</p>

<p>
    A new configuration file was added for the Micropay server. This follows the same pattern as the files provided for
    the verifier and sentinel.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message.fetchFromRandomNode()</span>, the new <span class="code">MicropayServer</span> run
    mode has been added as a consumer of <span class="code">ClientNodeManager.randomNode()</span>. As will be seen later
    in these notes, the <span class="code">MicropayServer</span> run mode currently shares the client's
    blockchain-tracking functionality. They have similar relationships to the mesh: neither services incoming Nyzo
    messages and neither will ever produce a block.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_1.png" alt="RN_530 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 440px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">RunMode</span>, <span class="code">MicropayServer</span> and
    <span class="code">MicropayClient</span> have been added. The Micropay server is a simple but fully functioning
    web server that collects Nyzo payments before allowing access to premium resources. The Micropay client is a
    lightweight local application that allows a user to interact with Micropay servers.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_2.png" alt="RN_530 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 135px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">ClientTransactionUtil</span>, the <span class="code">createAndSendTransaction()</span> methods
    have been refactored for readability and to expose intermediate calculations. The
    <span class="code">suggestedTransactionTimestamp()</span> method provides a timestamp that will allow for a new
    transaction to be created that will be approved in a reasonable amount of time <span class="emphasis">even if
    blockchain processing has fallen behind.</span> This calculation was previously performed in the
    <span class="code">createAndSendTransaction()</span> method, and it is now also used by the Micropay server to
    produce suggested timestamps for Micropay strings.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_3.png" alt="RN_530 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    Refactoring of the <span class="code">createAndSendTransaction()</span> method did not change its behavior. However,
    when an IP address and port are not provided, <span class="code">sendTransactionToCycle()</span> has been replaced
    with <span class="code">sendTransactionToExpectedVerifier()</span>. So, instead of sending the transaction to multiple
    verifiers, and continuing to send the transaction until the block that is supposed to contain the transaction is
    received, the transaction is only sent to the one verifier. This significantly reduces the network traffic required
    for each transaction while negligibly reducing the chance that the transaction will be incorporated into a block.
    This process should continue to be refined in the future to account for new verifiers and verifiers dropping from
    the cycle, but such refinements are small relative to the functionality already provided.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_4.png" alt="RN_530 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">sendTransactionToExpectedBlockVerifier()</span> method is used by both the client and the
    Micropay server. The <span class="code">waitForBlock</span> argument is used by the client to wait for the block
    that is supposed to contain the transaction. When this block is received, the user is informed whether the block
    contains the transaction, and the command completes. In the case of the Micropay server, such user feedback is an
    unnecessary overhead, so it is bypassed.
</p>

<p>
    This method uses the frozen edge, along with the ordered list of verifiers in the current cycle, to determine
    which verifier should process the block for the transaction. Note that the calculation works properly even when the
    ordered list of verifiers was generated for a different block than the frozen edge that was retrieved. While this
    is a rare occurrence, it can happen due to the multithreaded nature of the system.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_5.png" alt="RN_530 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">MicropayCreateCommand</span> and <span class="code">MicropaySendCommand</span> have been
    eliminated from the client. They were useful for exploring the mechanics of the Micropay system, but they are no
    longer appropriate due to changes in the Micropay string structure. To simplify design of the Micropay client and
    to reduce overall burden on the mesh, <span class="emphasis">Micropay clients do not track the blockchain.</span>
    This requires the Micropay server to provide a previous-block hash and suggested timestamp to Micropay clients.
    Those fields have such a limited lifetime that manual creation and use of Micropay strings is an unlikely use case.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_6.png" alt="RN_530 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 220px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">MicropayAuthorization</span> class is a simple container for tracking which users are allowed
    to access which endpoints on the Micropay server. As the comment explains, the class will evolve to allow more
    authorization-control options. Also, loading of previous authorizations from the blockchain will be added so that
    authorizations are not lost on server restart.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_7.png" alt="RN_530 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 525px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">MicropayClient</span> run mode has the simplest of all run mode initialization processes.
    The run mode is set, and the web listener is started. <span class="emphasis">The Micropay client does not track the
    blockchain.</span>
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_8.png" alt="RN_530 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 250px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">MicropayController</span> provides endpoints for both the Micropay server and the Micropay
    client. The Micropay client has two endpoints: the page for authorizing payments and a ping endpoint that is used
    for automatic port detection.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_9.png" alt="RN_530 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 380px;">

<p>
    The endpoints for the Micropay server are built dynamically based on the contents of the directory specified as
    <span class="code">micropay_data_root</span> in the preferences file. The <span class="code">process()</span>
    method recursively builds the server paths based on the directory structure.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_10.png" alt="RN_530 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 525px;">

<p>
    The Micropay client's ping page provides a plain text, known response to allow easy identification of a Micropay
    client. The page also displays the IP address of the requester, though this information is unused by the
    port-detection process.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_11.png" alt="RN_530 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 515px;">

<p>
    The Micropay client's authorization page is presented to ask whether the user wants to approve a Micropay
    transaction. If the Micropay information is valid, the client signs the transaction and sends it back to the
    Micropay server at the provided callback URL.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_12.png" alt="RN_530 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 525px;">

<p>
    The client authorization page will only create a transaction if the Micropay client has been configured correctly
    and if the transaction amount is less than the user-specified maximum. This protects a user from accidentally
    sending large transactions with Micropay.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_13.png" alt="RN_530 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 525px;">

<p>
    This is an example Micropay authorization page. While this is a web page, it is <span class="emphasis">served by the
    locally running Micropay client, not a remote server.</span>
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_14.png" alt="RN_530 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 425px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">MicropayEndpoint</span> class encapsulates all of the Micropay server's functionality for
    authorizing accesses and delivering content. The Micropay server automatically builds endpoints based on a directory
    structure, much like a typical web server. Content for an example Micropay site is
    <a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/micropayExample" target="_blank">available on Github</a>.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_15.png" alt="RN_530 code 15" class="code-image" style="width: 520px;">

<p>
    By default, a page on a Micropay site does not require payment. To require payment for a page, add the following
    tag to the <span class="code">head</span> element of the page. The following tag would require a payment of
    &cap;0.1 to access the page.
</p>

<p class="code">
    &ltmeta name="nyzo-micropay-amount" content="0.1"&gt
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">getMicropayAmount()</span> method extracts the Micropay value from the page. The standard
    Java libraries do not offer an HTML parser, and Nyzo seeks to limit dependencies as much as possible, so this method
    uses a regular expression and basic string manipulation to find the value.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_16.png" alt="RN_530 code 16" class="code-image" style="width: 460px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">renderByteArray()</span> method provides the page content to the web listener. If a page is
    free, if the user is previously authorized, or if the request contains a valid transaction, the page content is
    delivered. Otherwise, an authorization page is delivered.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_17.png" alt="RN_530 code 17" class="code-image" style="width: 425px;">

<p>
    The server authorization page is displayed when a user has not yet paid to access a piece of content. This page
    creates the appropriate Micropay string that the user must approve to access the content.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_18.png" alt="RN_530 code 18" class="code-image" style="width: 525px;">

<p>
    A script scans the most common ports on which a user might run a Micropay client: 80 and 8080 for http, 443 and 8443
    for https. The authorization link is pointed to the appropriate port.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_19.png" alt="RN_530 code 19" class="code-image" style="width: 525px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">processTransactionParameter()</span> method checks the transaction provided by the user. If
    the receiver, sender data, and amount are correct, and the transaction appears likely to be accepted into the
    blockchain, then the Micropay server forwards the transaction to the appropriate verifier and immediately provides
    access to the requested content.
</p>

<p>
    This method demonstrates what the Micropay system is all about: because of the way the Nyzo blockchain is
    structured, <span class="emphasis">anyone tracking the blockchain can easily determine whether a transaction is
    likely to be incorporated into the blockchain, and anyone in possession of a transaction can take the appropriate
    steps to try to get that transaction into the blockchain</span>. While some transactions will be lost, the small
    values of these transactions make periodic losses acceptable, and the system can be improved over time to lower
    transaction loss rate.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_20.png" alt="RN_530 code 20" class="code-image" style="width: 520px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">senderDataForIp()</span> method provides sender data for the transaction. The IP address and
    path are signed by the verifier, and the first 32 bytes of the signature are used for the sender data. As the
    comment notes, this calculation has some nice properties, but many any calculation that suits the needs of the
    Micropay server operator can be used.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_21.png" alt="RN_530 code 21" class="code-image" style="width: 520px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">MicropayServer</span> class is the entry point for the
    <span class="code">MicropayServer</span> run mode. The Micropay server shares the client's data manager for mesh
    and blockchain tracking, and a new class, <span class="code">TransactionTracker</span>, watches incoming blocks to
    report transactions for which this verifier is the recipient.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_22.png" alt="RN_530 code 22" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">TransactionTracker</span> class provides minimal reporting on transactions in incoming
    blocks. This class will provide more substantial reporting and help in the authorization process in future versions,
    potentially allowing exclusion of transactions from senders that are known to abuse the system.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_23.png" alt="RN_530 code 23" class="code-image" style="width: 530px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">NyzoStringEncoder</span> class now has the ability to decode transaction strings.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_24.png" alt="RN_530 code 24" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    In Micropay strings, the receiver IP address and receiver port have been removed, and timestamp and previous-block
    information added, to support the updated use of these strings. The new Micropay format is not compatible with the
    old format, and the old format and use case will no longer be supported.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_25.png" alt="RN_530 code 25" class="code-image" style="width: 520px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">NyzoStringTransaction</span> allows signed transactions to be represented as Nyzo strings. These
    are used in the Micropay process, and they will also be useful in many other situations.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_26.png" alt="RN_530 code 26" class="code-image" style="width: 340px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">NyzoStringType</span>, the prefix <span class="code">tx__</span> has been registered for
    transaction strings.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_27.png" alt="RN_530 code 27" class="code-image" style="width: 160px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">NyzoStringTest</span>, a test has been added for transaction strings.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_28.png" alt="RN_530 code 28" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    The test for Micropay strings has been updated for the new Micropay string structure.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_29.png" alt="RN_530 code 29" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">PreferencesUtil</span>, methods have been added for retrieving byte arrays and long values.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_30.png" alt="RN_530 code 30" class="code-image" style="width: 400px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">CycleController</span>, the signatures of the endpoint methods have changed to the new
    definition of <span class="code">EndpointMethod</span>. Query parameters are now passed into the method, along
    with request headers, and the <span class="code">EndpointResponse</span> return type contains the response
    headers in addition to the content.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_31.png" alt="RN_530 code 31" class="code-image" style="width: 480px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">EndpointMethod</span> interface, as noted above, is evolving to handle more of the necessary
    complexities of web requests and responses.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_32.png" alt="RN_530 code 32" class="code-image" style="width: 450px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">EndpointResponse</span> class contains response headers in addition to the response content.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_33.png" alt="RN_530 code 33" class="code-image" style="width: 360px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">SentinelController</span> has also been changed for the revised
    <span class="code">EndpointMethod</span> interface. Additionally, a small formatting issue has been corrected.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_34.png" alt="RN_530 code 34" class="code-image" style="width: 520px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">WebListener</span>, the constant for port has been replaced with a method for determining
    the port, which is now dependent on the run mode.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_35.png" alt="RN_530 code 35" class="code-image" style="width: 360px;">

<p>
    The endpoint map is no longer a constant (<span class="code">final</span>) variable. This change was made so that
    the loading process could be written to allow the map to be reloaded, allowing update of endpoints in the Micropay
    server without restart of the server. Note that this is not yet fully implemented: the Micropay server will pick up
    page content changes while running, <span class="emphasis">but Nyzo Micropay pricing metadata and the endpoint
    map are only currently read on server initialization, and the Micropay server must be restarted for these changes
    to be updated.</span>
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_36.png" alt="RN_530 code 36" class="code-image" style="width: 430px;">

<p>
    The new port method is used in place of the constant, and the port is logged so the operator of the server can
    ensure the correct port was used.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_37.png" alt="RN_530 code 37" class="code-image" style="width: 520px;">

<p>
    Endpoint methods are now provided with the query parameters and source IP address, and the headers returned in the
    <span class="code">EndpointResponse</span> are passed to the <span class="code">HttpExchange</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_38.png" alt="RN_530 code 38" class="code-image" style="width: 470px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">path()</span> method has been updated to provide some path normalization. A method has been
    added to extract query parameters into a map.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_39.png" alt="RN_530 code 39" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">buildEndpointMap()</span> now includes endpoints for the Micropay server and Micropay client.
    The process has been built to allow atomic swaps of the endpoint map. Dynamic endpoint map updates for the Micropay
    server will be implemented in a future version.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_40.png" alt="RN_530 code 40" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">getPort()</span> method provides more options than the previous
    <span class="code">port</span> constant. The <span class="code">web_port</span> constant is treated exactly as
    before, but run-mode-specific settings are now also available. For instance, to run the Micropay client on port 8081
    and all other run modes on port 8080, you would specify <span class="code">web_port_micropay=8081</span> and
    <span class="code">web_port=8080</span> in <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/preferences</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_41.png" alt="RN_530 code 41" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">WebUtil</span>, convenience constants have been added for inline button styles.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_42.png" alt="RN_530 code 42" class="code-image" style="width: 520px;">

<p>
    Classes have been added to structure links, paragraphs, and titles in HTML.
</p>

<img src="images/0530/rn_530_43.png" alt="RN_530 code 43" class="code-image" style="width: 220px;">

<p>
    To run a Micropay server, follow the same installation instructions as the Nyzo verifier, using the
    <span class="filename">nyzoMicropayServer.conf</span> file in place of the
    <span class="filename">nyzoVerifier.conf</span> file. Also, be sure to include some web content and specify the
    web root as <span class="code">micropay_data_root</span> in
    <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/preferences</span>. Content for an example Micropay site is
    <a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/micropayExample" target="_blank">available on Github</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The Micropay server uses the private key specified in
    <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/verifier_private_seed</span> as the recipient of all Micropay
    transactions. Be sure that this is an existing account, as new accounts are unable to receive small transactions due
    to balance-list spam protections.
</p>

<p>
    The Micropay client follows the same build process as all other run modes. It does not require the
    <span class="code">trusted_entry_points</span> file. It does require specification of
    <span class="code">micropay_sender_key</span> and <span class="code">micropay_max_amount_nyzos</span> in
    <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/verifier_private_seed</span>. The entry point for the client is
    <span class="code">co.nyzo.verifier.micropay.MicropayClient</span>. Micropay clients for mobile systems are
    currently under consideration for development.
