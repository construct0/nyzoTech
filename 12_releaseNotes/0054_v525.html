<h1>Nyzo 525: client transactions</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 525
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/d0381ab64bc77a828c77206c07c9f5c9de7da6a3"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds to the client the ability to send transactions.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version does not affect the verifier or sentinel. It only affects the client.
</p>

<p>
    The amount of code in this version is substantial, and there are a number of areas that are still developing and
    require refinement. However, unlike the client or sentinel, this lack of refinement will not cause security issues
    or jeopardize in-cycle verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">ArgumentResult</span> class is used to store validation information about arguments to
    client commands. This is used by the client to communicate validation issues to the user and allow correction of
    invalid arguments.
</p>

<p>
    The client loop has been reworked to allow validation and user confirmation of arguments for a command. The code
    is well-commented and explains how the looping works to allow editing when validation fails or the user chooses
    to edit the arguments at the confirmation step.
</p>

<p>
    Note that this kind of rather complicated control flow is uncommon in the Nyzo codebase. If this were logic that
    affected the security of the system, like much of the verifier and sentinel code, it would be structured quite
    differently to make the code easier to verify. User interface code and security-sensitive code have very different
    goals and should be held to very different standards of evaluation.
</p>

<p>
    The logic that selects a command has changed slightly to accommodate removal of the
    <span class="code">inCommandList</span> property from commands. With the exception of a few system commands, this
    value would have always been <span class="code">true</span>, so it was unnecessary clutter in the code.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">ClientDataManager</span> now sends a single ping to prime the message system, and it also
    creates a new mesh-request message for each trusted entry point. These changes were both made to reduce rejection
    of messages due to message-replay protection on verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">CommandManager</span> class now organizes the commands for the client. Previously, the
    high-level design of commands in the client involved a <span class="code">Command</span> enumeration, and each
    <span class="code">Command</span> referenced a <span class="code">CommandHandler</span> instance. While the
    enumeration of commands seemed superficially to be a good design, it led to a situation where command objects were
    unnaturally and arbitrarily split into commands and command handlers. This unnatural division was removed, and each
    command is now encapsulated in a single <span class="code">Command</span> object that contains all information
    about a command. Also, the <span class="code">inCommandList</span> property of a command has been eliminated in
    favor of simply omitting commands from the command manager's array of commands to exclude them from the list.
</p>

<p>
    The current design allows for easy extension of the client's functionality. To add a new command to the client,
    first create a class that implements the <span class="code">Command</span> interface. Then, add a new instance of
    the command to the <span class="code">commands</span> array in <span class="code">CommandManager</span>.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">ConsoleUtil</span>, color codes are now removed from length calculations that determine
    column widths. This allows text coloring to be applied to tables without affecting formatting.
</p>

<p>
    All of the <span class="code">CommandHandler</span> classes have been renamed as <span class="code">Command</span>
    classes to reflect the new, flattened nature of the class design. The
    <span class="code">BalanceDisplayCommand</span> now displays the Nyzo string of the wallet identifier in addition
    to the raw hex version. As time goes on, we plan to use Nyzo strings more frequently in place of raw hex strings.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">Command</span> interface is used by all client commands. If
    <span class="code">requiresValidation()</span> returns <span class="code">false</span>, then
    <span class="code">validate()</span> is never called and may return <span class="code">null</span>.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">PrivateNyzoStringCommand</span> creates Nyzo string private key and public ID strings from a
    raw hex private key seed.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">PublicNyzoStringCommand</span> creates a Nyzo string public ID string from a raw hex public
    ID. This command warns the user about the possibility of losing coins if the ID specified is not in the frozen
    edge's balance list.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">TransactionSendCommand</span> allows the client to send transactions directly to the cycle.
    This is an important step in reducing the importance of the Nyzo web server and promoting decentralization. To
    reduce the probability of input errors, only Nyzo strings are accepted for the sender private key and receiver
    public ID.
</p>

<p>
    The following shows a typical client session in which a transaction is sent. After client initialization,
    <span class="code">ST</span> selects the command for sending a transaction. The command collects user inputs and
    asks for confirmation. After confirmation, the transaction is sent directly to the mesh. The
    <span class="code">transaction not accepted</span> response is typical for later transactions, as the client
    continues sending transactions to verifiers until the block that should contain the transaction is received by the
    client. When the block that should contain the transaction is received by the client, a message is shown letting
    the user know if the transaction was included in the block.
</p>

<p>
    This command will be refined in future versions. However, this implementation is reasonably efficient and reasonably
    reliable, and it is a solid first implementation of this functionality.
