        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds the missing <span class="code">LayoutUtil</span> class and corrects
    corrupted icon files.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    Thank you to <a href="https://github.com/mocomaco" target="_blank">Moco</a> for opening
    <a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/micropayAndroid/issues/1" target="_blank">an issue</a> about the missing
    <span class="code">LayoutUtil</span> class on GitHub.
</p>

<p>
    Version 1 of the Android app does not build properly. The first problem was absence of the
    <span class="code">LayoutUtil</span> class in the <span class="code">co.nyzo.mobile.util</span> package.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">LayoutUtil</span> class contains a constant for
    <span class="code">recommendedMarginSize</span> and a method for providing a size, in pixels, that scales nicely
    across different screen resolutions, orientations, and display pixel densities.

<p>
    After adding this class, the project would still not build because the launcher icons had been corrupted by the
    transfer process used to produce this repository. These corrupt images were replaced with clean images.
