<h1>Nyzo 582: disconnected blocks</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 582
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/95bdb24a4559d5bf10549b09659211b8c548dd33"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) corrects a memory issue for disconnected blocks in the
    <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager</span>.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the verifier. This is a small but exceptionally important update. It discloses a vulnerability
    that can be exploited from a single location to overwhelm the memory of any verifier.
</p>

<p>
    The following two paragraphs are taken, verbatim, from the release notes for version 572. They are just as relevant
    to this version as they were to version 572.

<p class="quote">
    The openness of the Nyzo verifier, with its willingness to accept information on incoming connections, makes it
    especially susceptible to resource-consumption attacks. In the past, various potential attacks have been found by
    members of the community. The <span class="code">NicknameManager</span> issue, addressed in
    <a href="v500">version 500</a>, resulted in a &cap;75,000 bounty. The signature-buffer issue, addressed in
    <a href="v503">version 503</a>, resulted in a &cap;225,000 bounty. The <span class="code">TIME_WAIT</span> issue,
    addressed in <a href="v539">version 539</a>, resulted in a &cap;30,000 bounty.

    We will not recommend a specific bounty amount for this issue. We encourage the cycle to provide a bounty that
    appropriately acknowledges the value that report of this issue provides to the community. The fixes in this build
    eliminate a vulnerability that, if exploited correctly, could have resulted in a cycle stall, tremendous hassle for
    operators of verifiers, and loss of verification positions in the cycle.

    The reporter of this issue has provided the following address for receiving a bounty:

</ul>

<p>
    The actual code changes in this update are small. Previously, the disconnected-blocks map in
    <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager</span> was unlimited in size. It would accept blocks from any verifier, and
    it would accept blocks at any height in the future. An attacker, even one without any verifiers in the cycle, could
    send blocks marked far in the future to a verifier. These blocks would accumulate until the verifier ran out of
    memory.
</p>

<p>
    This version adds three protections to limit memory usage. Disconnected blocks are now only accepted from in-cycle
    verifiers. Blocks are only accepted 300 blocks past the frozen edge. Only two disconnected blocks are stored at each
    height.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager</span>, the <span class="code">disconnectedBlocks</span> map was marked
    as <span class="code">final</span>. The map is modified, but it is never changed.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">maximumDisconnectedBlocksPerHeight</span> constant indicates the maximum number of blocks
    that will be stored at a height. The <span class="code">maximumDisconnectedDistance</span> constant indicates the
    maximum distance past the frozen edge for which a disconnected block will be stored.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.registerBlock()</span>, the block height of the block is now stored in a
    local variable. This was changed to improve code readability.
</p>

<img src="images/0582/rn_582_1.png" alt="RN_582 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 370px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    Later in <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.registerBlock()</span>, the condition for accepting blocks without
    balance lists has two new considerations. Only blocks within <span class="code">maximumDisconnectedDistance</span>
    are stored, and only blocks from in-cycle verifiers are stored.
</p>

<p>
    When the <span class="code">disconnectedBlocksForHeight</span> map is retrieved, its size is checked. The block is
    only added if the current size is less than <span class="code">maximumDisconnectedBlocksPerHeight</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0582/rn_582_2.png" alt="RN_582 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 460px; max-height: 240px;">

<p>
    There are numerous improvements that could be made to this to further conserve memory and use memory more wisely.
    Cycle positions could be considered, and block sizes relative to recent blocks could be considered. These
    improvements will be introduced as an NTTP, and they will be implemented if the cycle deems their implementation
    worthwhile.
