<h1>Nyzo 521: improved join</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 521
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/2915b96ae1dc064549e92ee7120b082e31c736ac"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) improves the node-join process and out-of-cycle performance. It also adds
    another field to the private version of the status response to further aid in debugging UDP block-vote issues.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version only affects the verifier.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">MeshListener</span>, fields were added to track the counts of TCP and UDP block votes
    received. These fields are incremented in the appropriate locations.
</p>

<p>
    A method was added to allow the status response to access the vote-count information.
</p>

<p>
    Sending of the legacy node-join message has been eliminated from
    <span class="code">NodeManager.sendNodeJoinRequests()</span>. Such node-join messages are still supported and even
    sent in response to like messages (see <span class="code">NodeManager.updateNode()</span>), but this is the
    first step in removing this message from the system in favor of the version-2 node-join message.
</p>

<p>
    When reloading the node-join queue in <span class="code">NodeManager.requestMesh()</span>, the first two iterations
    seek only to connect to in-cycle nodes. While such preference to in-cycle nodes is neither necessary nor indicated
    by a precise concern, it is still a good design choice. Periodic node-join messages serve separate purposes for
    in-cycle and out-of-cycle nodes. For in-cycle nodes, these messages promote connectedness to ensure that the cycle
    can process the blockchain properly. For out-of-cycle nodes, these messages identify lapsed nodes to
    remove those nodes from the lottery.
</p>

<p>
    To compensate for the 2 iterations that only request in-cycle nodes, the <span class="code">haveNodeHistory</span>
    value is now set to <span class="code">true</span> 2 iterations later than it was before.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Verifier.requestBlockWithVotes()</span>, a minimum interval of 2 seconds between requests is
    now enforced. Without this interval, an out-of-cycle verifier would typically send at least 5 or 6 requests for
    each block before receiving and processing the first response. This minimum interval immediately reduces CPU and
    network usage on verifiers that update to this version, and CPU and network usage of all verifiers will further
    improve as more verifiers update to this version.

<p>
    In the private section of <span class="code">StatusResponse</span>, the new block-vote field has been added. This
    field shows the total number of block votes that have been received over TCP and UDP. This field was added to
    help diagnose problems with receipt of UDP block votes. If your verifier is operating properly, you can ignore
    this field. It is only intended to provide an extra piece of information to help fix verifiers that are not
    operating properly.
