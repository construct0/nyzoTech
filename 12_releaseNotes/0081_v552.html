<h1>Nyzo 552: cycle transaction script</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 552
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/2ec62cc28f0c8fd2a826afcef5be5aa2945874d5"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds the <span class="code">CycleTransactionSignScript</span>.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version does not affect the verifier or sentinel significantly. It adds a script, and it refactors some
    sentinel initialization code to allow the code to be reused cleanly by the script. The sentinel changes are minor,
    and they are isolated to the initialization process.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message</span>, a new constructor has been added that allows specification of a seed for
    signing the message. This is a shortcut to using the existing constructor and using the
    <span class="code">sign()</span> method to resign the message. Using this constructor saves the extra
    computation that would otherwise be needed to sign the message twice.

<p>
    In <span class="code">MessageType</span>, a comment has been revised to provide a more accurate description.
</p>

<img src="images/0552/rn_552_1.png" alt="RN_552 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">CycleTransactionSignScript</span> takes a single argument, the Nyzo string of the transaction
    to be signed.
</p>

<p>
    The script checks the signature, loads the managed verifiers, initializes the frozen edge, attempts to find the
    transaction, and fetches the cycle. These are all the pieces of information that are necessary to sign the
    transaction and send it to the cycle. If any of the necessary information is unavailable, the script prints an error
    message and exits.
</p>

<p>
    The pattern of early return from a method is not frequently used in Nyzo. Generally, methods are allowed to reach
    the end of their code, and return statements are seldom found anywhere other than the final line of a method.
    However, this pattern is simple and easy to understand in the specific case of this method, and it is applied
    consistently for the entirety of the method.
</p>

<p>
    The signature for a transaction can most easily be obtained from the
    <a href="https://nyzo.co/cycleTransactions" target="_blank">Nyzo website cycle transactions page.</a> When a
    transaction's <span class="code">sign this transaction</span> button is selected, a page with the transaction
    details is displayed. On that page, the Nyzo signature string of the transaction is contained in the URL.
</p>

<p>
    If all the necessary information is found to be available, the <span class="code">signTransactions()</span> method
    finishes by invoking the <span class="code">sendSignatures()</span> method with the collected information.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">getTransaction()</span> method uses the transaction signature to find a cycle transaction.
    All cycle transactions are registered with the <span class="code">CycleTransactionManager</span> class. This method
    looks to the <span class="code">CycleTransactionManager</span> as a source for the cycle transactions. If
    necessary, the method will query all of the managed verifiers to try to obtain the specified transaction.
</p>

<img src="images/0552/rn_552_5.png" alt="RN_552 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">processTransactionListResponse()</span> method registers received cycle transactions with the
    <span class="code">CycleTransactionManager</span>.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">fetchCycle()</span> method retrieves a list of all in-cycle nodes from one of the managed
    verifiers.
</p>

<img src="images/0552/rn_552_7.png" alt="RN_552 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">sendSignatures()</span> method sends a signature for every managed verifier to every node in
    the cycle. So, a cycle of 1500 and 30 managed verifiers would result in 45,000 messages. As will be discussed below,
    the <span class="code">ScriptUtil.sendMessages()</span> method allows such a large volume of messages to be sent
    relatively quickly.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">PendingMessage</span> class encapsulates the information needed for building a Nyzo message
    and some tracking information to facilitate retries. This class is important &mdash; it, along with the
    <span class="code">ScriptUtil.sendMessages()</span> method, allows for flexible, concise, robust, and efficient
    sending of large volumes of messages.
</p>

<img src="images/0552/rn_552_9.png" alt="RN_552 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 530px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">ScriptUtil</span>, two parameters have been added for the new
    <span class="code">sendMessages()</span> method. The <span class="code">maximumInFlightRequests</span> parameter
    limits how many requests are allowed to be awaiting response simultaneously, and the
    <span class="code">maximumMessageAttempts</span> parameter limits how many times a message is sent, regardless of
    whether it receives a valid response.
</p>

<img src="images/0552/rn_552_10.png" alt="RN_552 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 530px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">sendMessages()</span> method sends no more than one message per loop iteration. If no
    suitable message is found, the thread sleeps for a short period to allow responses and errors to be registered.
    The method is designed to ensure that every message specified in the set either receives a valid response or is
    attempted the maximum number of times specified by the <span class="code">maximumMessageAttempts</span> parameter.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Sentinel</span>, the <span class="code">managedVerifiersFile</span> field has been exposed
    publicly to allow it to be used in an error message in <span class="code">CycleTransactionSignScript</span> when the
    <span class="filename">managed_verifiers</span> file is empty or missing.
</p>

<img src="images/0552/rn_552_12.png" alt="RN_552 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 530px;">

<p>
    Fetching and processing of bootstrap responses has been moved from the <span class="code">Sentinel</span> class to
    the <span class="code">initializeFrozenEdge()</span> method of the <span class="code">SentinelUtil</span> class.
    This refactoring was performed to allow <span class="code">CycleTransactionSignScript</span> to share the method.
</p>

<p>
    Storage of <span class="code">frozenEdge</span> and setting of <span class="code">lastBlockReceivedTimestamp</span>
    were previously in the <span class="code">processBootstrapResponse()</span> method. These were specific to the
    <span class="code">Sentinel</span> class, and therefore not suitable for sharing with the
    <span class="code">CycleTransactionSignScript</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0552/rn_552_13.png" alt="RN_552 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 520px;">

<p>
    Most of the code moved from <span class="code">Sentinel</span> to <span class="code">SentinelUtil</span> was left
    unchanged. The only consequential code block that was eliminated was the initial entry into fast-fetch mode. This
    was eliminated because it was not truly necessary and because the absence of
    <span class="code">chainFrozenEdge</span> in the <span class="code">Sentinel.start()</span> method added minor
    complication to potential reimplementation of this functionality in that method. Now, the sentinel does not start
    in fast-fetch mode. However, as has always been the case, it quickly switches to fast-fetch mode if necessary.
</p>

<p>
    To use the new script, configure a <span class="filename">managed_verifiers</span> file just as you would for a
    sentinel. Then, after updating to version 552 or later, run the following command from the
    <span class="filename">nyzoVerifier</span> directory, replacing the signature with the signature of the cycle
    transaction you want to sign:
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo java -jar build/libs/nyzoVerifier-1.0.jar co.nyzo.verifier.scripts.CycleTransactionSignScript
    sig_g3gMk7KyJM_Kf~5oV~oS1TfULhjEg9JIdXqFfdxsWA-1AyZP3EXDgs39V3eKxSwxLN3ecgUPiPaea5Gd_QGGrgvjtBth
</p>

<p>
    The command can be run on a system devoted to running scripts, or it can be run on an existing sentinel, including
    while the sentinel is running.
