<h1>Nyzo 505: performance rating</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 505
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/a1e8a54255535a71e640ac2bef39cea5b85bdf58"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) introduces a verifier-performance rating.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version only affects the verifier, but it does not affect the behavior of the verifier in a significant way.
    Upgrading to this version is optional.
</p>

<p>
    Since the introduction of the sentinel, verifiers have been able to stay in the cycle even when they have
    performance or stability issues. While the sentinel is a valuable tool to keep the cycle from losing verifiers,
    over-reliance on it can lead to performance issues for the cycle at large. A verifier scoring system is necessary
    to ensure that verifiers that continually under-perform to the detriment of the cycle are eventually removed from
    the cycle.
</p>

<p>
    Due to the remarkable efforts of the community in proactively improving verifier performance, this verifier-rating
    system is not as urgent of a need as it seemed to be several days ago. To avoid unfairly removing verifiers that
    are attempting to maintain proper performance, <span class="emphasis">this version does not yet use verifier-
    performance scores to remove under-performing verifiers from the cycle</span>. Removal based on these performance
    scores will be implemented soon.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">MeshListener</span> class, the new
    <span class="code">PerformanceScoreStatusRequest418</span> message type produces a
    <span class="code">PerformanceScoreStatusResponse</span>. Also, unrelated to verifier performance scores, the
    <span class="code">ResetRequest500</span> message, which resets the internal verifier state and restarts the
    verifier, has been changed to only respond to messages signed by the local verifier. Previously, this mechanism
    could be triggered by messages signed by the same private key that signed the Genesis block. It was a convenience
    that we used in testing, and we intended to remove it before release.

<p>
    In the <span class="code">processContent()</span> method of the <span class="code">Message</span> class, building
    of the <span class="code">PerformanceScoreStatusResponse</span> from byte buffers has been added. When a Nyzo
    message is received, the numerical type of the message is checked, and this method deserializes the object if there
    is one associated with the type.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">MessageType</span> enumeration, <span class="code">PerformanceScoreStatusRequest418</span>
    and <span class="code">PerformanceScoreStatusResponse419</span> have been added, and the note to change the key
    for the reset message has been removed.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">Verifier</span> class updates the <span class="code">VerifierPerformanceManager</span>
    scores each time a block is frozen.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">VerifierPerformanceManager</span> is a simple class with a simple scoring system. Higher
    numerical scores indicate poorer verifier performance, and lower numerical scores indicate better verifier
    performance. Each time a block is frozen, the score of every verifier increases by <span class="code">3</span>.
    However, the score of each verifier that voted for the block that was just frozen then decreases by
    <span class="code">6</span>. So, if this verifier is receiving votes for at least 50% of blocks from another
    verifier, then the score of that other verifier will remain stable or improve on this verifier.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">printScores()</span> method of <span class="code">VerifierPerformanceManager</span> class
    is used for writing the score file and for the <span class="code">PerformanceScoreStatusResponse</span> content.
    Each identifier and score are written on a single line, and a comment adds the nickname to improve readability.
    Scores are written from high to low, so the poorest-performing verifiers are at the top of the list.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">PerformanceScoreStatusResponse</span> is a standard multi-line text response. As only
    in-cycle verifiers are scored, the size of this response is guaranteed to grow slowly.
</p>

<p>
    The functionality of the <span class="code">ConsensusTallyStatusRequestScript</span> has been refactored into the
    <span class="code">fetchMultilineStatus()</span> method of <span class="code">ScriptUtil</span> class. This method
    is used by the <span class="code">ConsensusTallyStatusRequestScript</span> and the new
    <span class="code">PerformanceScoreStatusRequestScript</span>.
</p>

<p>
    These scripts work for both local and remote queries. To run the
    <span class="code">PerformanceScoreStatusRequestScript</span> script on your verifier, ssh to the verifier,
    navigate to the <span class="filename">nyzoVerifier</span> directory, and run the following command:
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo java -jar build/libs/nyzoVerifier-1.0.jar co.nyzo.verifier.scripts.PerformanceScoreStatusRequestScript
</p>

<p>
    If you want to run the script from a system that is not an in-cycle verifier, provide the private seed of an
    in-cycle verifier. The script will query verifier0.nyzo.co to obtain the current mesh, and it will find your
    verifier in the mesh and send a self-signed message to it. The command for this is similar to the previous command:
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo java -jar build/libs/nyzoVerifier-1.0.jar co.nyzo.verifier.scripts.PerformanceScoreStatusRequestScript [seed of
    in-cycle verifier]
</p>
