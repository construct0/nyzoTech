<h1>Nyzo 545: sentinel reporting&thinsp;/&thinsp;consensus tracking</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 545
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/acbade0c8247bbf857630c0e37e875627497062a"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds a small sentinel monitoring improvement and some minor changes to
    consensus tracking.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects reporting for the sentinel and the consensus-tracking feature for verifiers. It does not affect
    any critical functionality.
</p>

<p>
    Following the recent sentinel bug, apprehension regarding use of newer versions of Nyzo would be understandable.
    However, versions of the code before 542 do not work with version 1 of the blockchain, which will likely go live in
    the next few days. To promote greater confidence in the newest sentinel version, reporting has been added to show
    transmission results when blocks are sent to the mesh.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">BlockVote.toString()</span> method now includes the sender identifier. This was added
    specifically for the consensus-tracking feature.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Sentinel</span>, a persistent field has been added for the results of the last block
    transmission.
</p>

<p>
    The print statement showing the minimum-vote timestamp distance is now using <span class="code">LogUtil</span>. This
    is a part of the ongoing effort to transition appropriate statements to use this class.
</p>

<p>
    In the transmission of the block to the cycle, a callback has been added to process the response. An
    <span class="code">AtomicInteger</span> is used to count the number of valid responses received. While simple, this
    feedback is incredibly useful, as it will capture many different potential error conditions.
</p>

<p>
    The statement indicating that a block has been sent has also been changed to use <span class="code">LogUtil</span>.
</p>

<p>
    After 3 seconds, the number of successful block transmissions is stored, and the number of failures is calculated as
    the difference between the size of the <span class="code">combinedCycle</span> set and the number of successes.
    These values will also reveal issues that might arise in this cycle set. The transmission-results string is printed
    using <span class="code">LogUtil</span> and stored for later access.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">lastBlockTransmissionResults</span> field has been exposed for use in the sentinel web
    interface.
</p>

<p>
    The range of data accepted by the consensus tracker has been extended an additional 2 blocks behind the frozen edge.
    While such delayed data would certainly not play a role in the consensus process, it might become useful for
    diagnosing timing issues with verifiers or sentinels.
</p>

<p>
    In writing the consensus file, the <span class="code">toString()</span> methods of <span class="code">Block</span>
    and <span class="code">BlockVote</span> are now used. This makes the code more concise and also improves the quality
    of the output.
</p>

<img src="images/0545/rn_545_8.png" alt="RN_545 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 560px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">SentinelController</span>, the last-block transmission results are now displayed.
</p>

<p>
    The block-transmission results appear as follows in the sentinel web interface.

<p>
    An active sentinel running the monitoring interface is accessible at
    <a target="_blank" href="http://quark.nyzo.co">quark.nyzo.co</a>. There are a number of reasons
    <span class="emphasis">not</span> to expose the sentinel web interface publicly like this, and we are only running
    this sentinel as a demonstration. When activating the web interface on sentinels, a firewall should be used to
    control access.
