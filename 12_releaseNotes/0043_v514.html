<h1>Nyzo 514: UDP node-join vulnerability</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 514
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/d2be2989739065da4c403600fee37699ca1dbedc"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) corrects a vulnerability related to node-join messages and UDP. It also
    contains several inconsequential changes to eliminate clutter in the code.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version only affects the verifier. The sentinel does not accept incoming messages.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">MeshListener</span>, a set has been defined for disallowed UDP types. While only node-join
    messages should ever require filtering, the response messages have also been added to this exclusion list for an
    extra level of protection. This filtering is necessary because UDP source IP addresses can be spoofed, which would
    allow an attacker to cause the NodeManager map to grow uncontrollably by sending node-join messages with many
    different source IP addresses. In a future version, a map-limiting protection similar to that found in
    <span class="code">NicknameManager</span> will be implemented in <span class="code">NodeManager</span>.

<p>
    The method that processes incoming UDP messages now checks for excluded types. Also, the count of UDP block votes
    is no longer incremented, as UDP messaging has already been deployed successfully to most of the cycle and requires
    no further tracking.

<p>
    In <span class="code">Verifier</span>, all code relating to uncertain support of the block-with-votes message has
    been removed. This message was added in version 476, and its support in the cycle is 100%.

<p>
    In <span class="code">StatusResponse</span>, the UDP-block-vote count has been removed. It is no longer needed and
    no longer used.
