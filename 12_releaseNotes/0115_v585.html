<h1>Nyzo 585: relay server improvements</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 585
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/da9f8ae84af806a9f69758e1244829dd2ec62c9c"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) improves the operation of the relay server.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the relay server only.
</p>

<p>
    This version is due to some issues that arose on <span class="code">relay0.nyzo.co</span> and
    <span class="code">relay1.nyzo.co</span>. The refresh loops on those servers became frozen, causing them to deliver
    stale data.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">RelayEndpoint.refresh()</span>, the connect timeout and read timeout are now set on the
    <span class="code">URLConnection</span>. The endpoints are refreshed in a loop. Previously, a single connection
    could stall the loop and effectively disable refreshing of all endpoints.

<p>
    In the main loop of <span class="code">RelayEndpointManager</span>, the refresh of each endpoint is now wrapped in a
    <span class="code">try</span>/<span class="code">catch</span> block. This ensures that an exception refreshing an
    endpoint does not cause problems outside that particular refresh operation.
