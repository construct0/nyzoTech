<h1>Nyzo 500: nickname manager memory</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 500
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/740a5c8a9814acb4d1c6763f0257bf91de1663e5"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) corrects a stability issue with the nickname manager.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the verifier only. The sentinel does not use the nickname manager.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">NicknameManager</span> class provides storage and lookup of verifier nicknames. These
    nicknames are for convenience and amusement only, and they are not considered in any blockchain calculations.
    However, this class was causing a stability issue because it did not have any protections in place to limit memory
    usage. This version adds some simple but effective protections to ensure the
    <span class="code">NicknameManager</span> class does not consume excessive memory.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">NicknameManager</span> class, <span class="code">nicknameMap</span> has been changed to a
    <span class="code">ConcurrentHashMap</span> to improve thread safety. A constant for
    <span class="code">maximumNicknameLength</span> has been added, also.

<p>
    The actual protection logic is coarse but effective. Before, nicknames were added to the map without any checks on
    length and without any consideration of the size of the map. In this version, a check on nickname length has been
    added, and non-cycle verifiers are excluded from the map after it has reached a size of 2000. Note there is no
    cleanup logic, so the map size is still technically unbounded, but the rate is so slow that this is not enough of a
    concern to justify additional code complexity.
