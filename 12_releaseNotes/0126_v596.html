<h1>Nyzo 596: cycle digest</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 596
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/621f16c8acbd986dcfb127c5797659490f5c9410"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) introduces the <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> class.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version does not affect operation of any run modes significantly. It lays the groundwork for substantial
    verifier improvements.
</p>

<p>
    The largest remaining performance problems of Nyzo are related to management of blocks. Consider the possibility
    that Nyzo begins processing transactions as a sustained rate of 1,000 per second. This would be 7,000 transactions
    per block. At the current cycle length of 2,124, about 8,500 blocks remain in memory in
    <span class="code">BlockManager</span>. This would mean that about 60,000,000 transactions would be in memory. This
    is not unmanageable, but it is wasteful. And we can do better.
</p>

<p>
    This version takes a first step into improving the performance of block management with introduction of the
    <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> class. The class is intended to be a replacement of the
    <span class="code">CycleInformation</span> class. In this version, the <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> class
    is only used by a test script. In a later version, <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> will take the place of
    <span class="code">CycleInformation</span>, and <span class="code">CycleInformation</span> will be removed from the
    codebase.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">ContinuityState</span> enumeration was removed from the <span class="code">Block</span>
    class, placed instead in a separate file. This change was made to simplify code structure.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Block.calculateCycleInformation()</span>, the calculation of
    <span class="code">maximumCycleLength</span> was unnecessarily complicated, and it was actually incorrect in some
    cases as a result. The incorrect cases were instances when the value was 1 greater than it should have been, and the
    incorrect value was inconsequential.
</p>

<p>
    The one place this value is used is in the <span class="code">Block.determineContinuityState()</span> method. In
    this method, the value is used to apply proof-of-diversity rule 2.
</p>

<p class="code-block">
    // Proof-of-diversity rule 2: Past the Genesis block, the cycle of a block must be longer than half<br>
    // of one more than the maximum of the all cycle lengths in this cycle and the previous two cycles.<br>
    <br>
    long threshold = (cycleInformation.getMaximumCycleLength() + 1L) / 2L;<br>
    boolean rule2Pass = getBlockHeight() == 0 || cycleInformation.getCycleLength() > threshold;<br>
    continuityState = rule2Pass ? ContinuityState.Continuous : ContinuityState.Discontinuous;<br>
</p>

<p>
    In place of the inline calculation while iterating through blocks, the <span class="code">maximumCycleLength</span>
    value is calculated from the appropriate <span class="code">primaryCycleLengths</span> values.
</p>

<p>
    The wording of rule 2 makes clear the values needed: the length of the current cycle (index 0) and the length of the
    previous two cycles (indices 1 and 2). Renaming of this field in a future version, to improve code readability,
    would probably be wise.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">ContinuityState</span> enumeration, removed from the <span class="code">Block</span> class,
    is now in its own file.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> class, as the comment explains, is a drop-in replacement the
    <span class="code">CycleInformationClass</span>. The list of <span class="code">identifiers</span> eliminates the
    need to continue looking at blocks to determine cycle properties. To produce the cycle digest for a block, only the
    cycle digest from the previous block and the identifier of the next block are needed.
</p>

<p>
    The accessors of <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> are exactly those provided by the
    <span class="code">CycleInformation</span> class.
</p>

<img src="images/0596/rn_596_5.png" alt="RN_596 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 320px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">CycleDigest.digestForNextBlock()</span> method adds the next block's identifier to the list
    of identifiers and calculates cycles from the resulting list. Compare this logic to the logic of the
    <span class="code">Block.calculateCycleInformation()</span> method. This method is much less complicated,
    much easier to understand, and the resulting information is the same.
</p>

<img src="images/0596/rn_596_6.png" alt="RN_596 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 430px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">calculateCycleLengths()</span> method is used by the <span class="code">CycleDigest</span>
    constructor to derive cycle lengths from cycle indices.
</p>

<img src="images/0596/rn_596_7.png" alt="RN_596 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 180px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">CycleDigest.toString()</span> method presents the same information presented by
    <span class="code">CycleInformation.toString()</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0596/rn_596_8.png" alt="RN_596 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 60px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">CycleInformation.getWindowStartHeight()</span> method was removed. It was unused.
</p>

<img src="images/0596/rn_596_9.png" alt="RN_596 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 130px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">NodeManager</span>, the <span class="code">newNodeIpToPortMap</span> was changed to
    <span class="code">final</span>. This is a minor change unrelated to other changes in this version.
</p>

<img src="images/0596/rn_596_10.png" alt="RN_596 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 380px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">SignatureState</span> enumeration was moved to its own file to simplify code structure.
</p>

<img src="images/0596/rn_596_11.png" alt="RN_596 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 230px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Verifier</span>, references to <span class="code">ContinuityState</span> were updated. This
    does not affect behavior.
</p>

<img src="images/0596/rn_596_12.png" alt="RN_596 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 180px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">CycleDigestTest</span> loads blocks from consolidated files into the
    <span class="code">BlockManager</span>. It creates <span class="code">CycleInformation</span> and
    <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> objects for each block and compares their properties. If any property does
    not match between the objects, a message is printed and the test exits immediately. Otherwise, the test continues
    to run as long as contiguous consolidated files are available.
</p>

<img src="images/0596/rn_596_13.png" alt="RN_596 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 610px;">

<p>
    Three overloads of the check method compare values of different types. If any two values are not equal, a message is
    presented and the program exits.
</p>
