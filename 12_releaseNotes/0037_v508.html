<h1>Nyzo 508: performance penalties</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 508
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/fd0e54fc253eae61a2ceacd91b57d3948ef4060b"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) begins to apply block-score penalties based on performance scores.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects primarily the verifier, but its message-replay protection also improves the sentinel.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">chainScore()</span> method of the <span class="code">Block</span> class, the dormant
    penalty that was once applied to inactive nodes is now applied to nodes that the cycle agrees have unacceptable
    performance. The penalty is only applied to blocks with a score of <span class="code">0</span>. This avoids
    problems that would otherwise be caused by two consecutive verifiers with unacceptable performance.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">BlockManager</span> class, the sets for cycle and near-cycle lookups have been changed
    to concurrent versions to improve thread safety, and a field has been added to track the last height at which a
    verifier was removed from the cycle.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">lastVerifierRemovalHeight</span> field is set in the
    <span class="code">updateVerifiersInCurrentCycle</span> method. The update is convenient here, because a simple
    comparison of the previous and new cycle lengths is sufficient for detecting a dropped verifier.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">MeshListener</span> class, a protection has been added against replay attacks. All
    messages are timestamped, and the timestamp is part of the signature. However, the timestamps were not being
    checked, and this would allow attackers to save and replay messages in ways that could cause a number of undesirable
    behaviors. This issue was reported by a member of the community and is subject to a bounty. This fix was initially
    planned for a later release, but replay attacks could be used to undermine the verifier-removal process, so this fix
    was promoted to this build to improve the integrity of the new process.
</p>

<p>
    Also in the <span class="code">MeshListener</span> class, logic has been added to handle two new messages
    necessary for the removal process. <span class="code">VerifierRemovalVote39</span> allows the in-cycle verifiers to
    reach a pre-consensus about which verifiers to remove, and
    <span class="code">VerifierRemovalTallyStatusRequest420</span> allows the person who controls a verifier to see the
    tally of verifier-removal votes. This process is similar to the new-verifier pre-consensus process, but it allows
    votes for multiple verifiers simultaneously.
</p>

<img src="images/0508/rn_508_4.png" alt="RN_508 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 481px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">Message</span> class, replay protection has also been added for responses to outgoing
    messages.
</p>

<img src="images/0508/rn_508_5.png" alt="RN_508 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 543px;">

<p>
    Various minor cleanups were performed on the <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteManager</span> class. The vote map
    has been changed to a concurrent map to improve thread safety, and all method synchronization has been removed, as
    it is no longer necessary. The <span class="code">acceptAllVotes</span> conditions, useful in some early testing
    scripts, have also been removed.
</p>

<img src="images/0508/rn_508_6.png" alt="RN_508 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 565px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">Verifier</span> class, the sleep time after an iteration in which a block has not been
    frozen has been reduced from 1.0 seconds to 0.3 seconds. This has a negligible effect on CPU usage, but it does
    improve the average interval between blocks by a small amount, which will help the cycle produce blocks quickly
    enough to keep up with the open edge.
</p>

<img src="images/0508/rn_508_7.png" alt="RN_508 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 220px;">

<p>
    Cleanup processes for the verifier-removal and new-verifier vote maps have been added. The new-verifier cleanup
    process was inadvertently omitted from previous versions, and implementation of the verifier-removal process
    caused us to notice its absence.
</p>

<img src="images/0508/rn_508_8.png" alt="RN_508 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 336px;">

<p>
    When a block is frozen, after performance scores are updated, removal votes are sent based on the performance
    scores. Also, the tally of removal votes received from other verifiers in the cycle is updated.
</p>

<img src="images/0508/rn_508_9.png" alt="RN_508 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 478px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">VerifierPerformanceManager</span> class, <span class="code">perVoteDecrement</span> has
    been changed from <span class="code">-6</span> to <span class="code">-5</span>. This changes the level at which a
    verifier can maintain a stable score from 50% to 60% of votes. This, does not change the maximum amount of time
    that a verifier can stay in the cycle while unresponsive, and it does not change the maximum credit that a verifier
    can receive for good performance. It only raises the baseline long-term performance requirement. This was changed
    because, based on observations of scores produced in 506, the 3-to-6 ratio appeared insufficient for removing
    verifiers whose performance negatively impacted the cycle.
</p>

<img src="images/0508/rn_508_10.png" alt="RN_508 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 553px;">

<p>
    The filename for storing scores has been changed. This will reset scores for all verifiers while retaining the old
    scores for reference. This ensures that no verifiers are penalized for their performance before this build was
    released. The constant and map are both used by the method that sends removal votes to other verifiers in the cycle.
</p>

<img src="images/0508/rn_508_11.png" alt="RN_508 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 598px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">getVerifiersOverThresold()</span> method produces a list of all verifiers whose performance
    scores warrant a removal vote. The list is limited to the maximum list size allowed by the
    <span class="code">VerifierRemovalVote</span> message, with verifiers with the least-worst performance scores
    being dropped from the list if necessary.
</p>

<img src="images/0508/rn_508_12.png" alt="RN_508 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 486px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">sendVotes()</span> method uses a timestamp-based technique to send removal votes to the
    entire cycle at a controlled rate. Each time a block is frozen, a number of votes (10, according to the
    <span class="code">messagesPerIteration</span> constant) are sent to other verifiers in the cycle. The timestamp
    map ensures, roughly, that each verifier receives the same number of votes over time and that those votes are
    spaced rather evenly. This method also ensures that removal messages do not add additional bursts of message
    activity to the verifier.
</p>

<img src="images/0508/rn_508_13.png" alt="RN_508 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 393px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">VerifierRemovalManager</span> class functions like the other vote-tally managers
    (<span class="code">BlockVoteManager</span>, <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteManager</span>), with the one
    variation being the allowance that a single verifier may vote for several verifiers for removal. If any verifier
    receives removal votes from more than half the cycle, that verifier may be removed from the cycle. Multiple
    verifiers may be eligible for removal at once, but the rate of removal is controlled to ensure that the cycle
    does not decrease in size too quickly.
</p>

<img src="images/0508/rn_508_14.png" alt="RN_508 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 501px;">

<p>
    The last removal height has been added to the status response so that any issues in its calculation can be spotted
    promptly.
</p>

<img src="images/0508/rn_508_15.png" alt="RN_508 code 15" class="code-image" style="width: 480px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">VerifierRemovalVote</span> object is used to communicate verifier performance issues
    among in-cycle verifiers. A protection has been included to ensure that no verifier votes for another verifier
    more than once.
</p>

<img src="images/0508/rn_508_16.png" alt="RN_508 code 16" class="code-image" style="width: 529px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">VerifierRemovalTallyStatusResponse</span> provides insight into the vote-removal tally on
    a verifier. This is a debug request, so it must be self-signed. It is similar to
    <span class="code">NewVerifierTallyStatusResponse</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0508/rn_508_17.png" alt="RN_508 code 17" class="code-image" style="width: 456px;">

<p>
    To reduce code duplication, <span class="code">NewVerifierTallyStatusRequestScript</span> has been modified to use
    the <span class="code">ScriptUtil.fetchMultilineStatus()</span> method. Also,
    <span class="code">VerifierRemovalTallyStatusRequestScript</span> has been added with the same template.
</p>

<img src="images/0508/rn_508_18.png" alt="RN_508 code 18" class="code-image" style="width: 434px;">

<p>
    For finding the message-replay issue, a total of &cap;150,000 will be awarded to e50a...1aec. This bounty is
    especially large due to the number of current and potential future attacks that could be executed easily by replay
    of messages. The transactions will be posted here after they are confirmed.
