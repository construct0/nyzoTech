<h1>Nyzo 543: consensus tracking</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 543
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/26098c3c9702fbc66a27f1346e4901e91f20b3cd"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds optional consensus tracking and a small sentinel-monitoring change.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects primarily the verifier. It also includes a minor monitoring change for the sentinel.
</p>

<p>
    The verifier identifier has been added to the <span class="code">Block.toString()</span> method.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockVoteManager</span>, all non-null votes are now registered with the new
    <span class="code">ConsensusTracker</span>. If the tracker is not enabled, this method does nothing.
</p>

<p>
    Unrelated to the consensus tracker, the <span class="code">activationHeight</span> is now considered when scoring
    blocks to determine if a block is a missed upgrade opportunity or an improperly timed upgrade.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">PersistentData</span>, reading of the file has been modified to support values that contain
    equals signs.
</p>

<img src="images/0543/rn_543_3.png" alt="RN_543 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager</span>, all non-null blocks are registered with the
    <span class="code">ConsensusTracker</span>. This uses the same registration method used for votes. A height is
    provided to this method to help the tracker organize its data.
</p>

<img src="images/0543/rn_543_4.png" alt="RN_543 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Verifier</span>, freezing of blocks is registered with the
    <span class="code">ConsensusTracker</span>. Also, maintenance is performed each time a block is frozen. This allows
    the <span class="code">ConsensusTracker</span> to periodically write old data to files and remove it from memory.
</p>

<img src="images/0543/rn_543_5.png" alt="RN_543 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    A logging statement was removed from <span class="code">BlockResponse</span>. This statement was not particularly
    helpful, and it was cluttering the output. If logging of blocks responses is added again in the future, it will be
    done at an aggregate level.
</p>

<img src="images/0543/rn_543_6.png" alt="RN_543 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 530px;">

<p>
    A persistent value storing the full string representation of the last block transmitted has been added to the
    <span class="code">Sentinel</span> class. This new value is displayed by the
    <span class="code">SentinelController</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0543/rn_543_7.png" alt="RN_543 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 530px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">ConsensusEvent</span> encapsulates data points for the
    <span class="code">ConsensusTracker</span>. Each event includes a timestamp, height, and data object.
</p>

<img src="images/0543/rn_543_8.png" alt="RN_543 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 270px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">ConsensusTracker</span> collects data about the consensus process and writes one or more file for
    each height. To enable the <span class="code">ConsensusTracker</span>, add the following line to
    <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/preferences</span>:
</p>

<p class="command">
    enable_consensus_tracker=1
</p>

<p>
    By default, the tracker will disable itself when available disk space falls below 20GB. A higher or lower threshold
    can be specified in the preferences file. For instance, if you want the tracker to disable itself when available
    disk space falls below 30GB, add the following line to
    <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/preferences</span>:
</p>

<p class="command">
    consensus_tracker_storage_threshold_bytes=30000000000
</p>

<img src="images/0543/rn_543_9.png" alt="RN_543 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 490px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">register()</span> method adds an event to the map. Events outside a reasonable height range
    are rejected, and concurrency concerns are handled appropriately. If a set of events at a particular height has
    gotten too large, it is written to a file prematurely to conserve memory.
</p>

<img src="images/0543/rn_543_10.png" alt="RN_543 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">performMaintenance()</span> method removes completed or excessively large heights from memory
    and writes them to files. It also deactivates the consensus tracker if available storage space has fallen below the
    specified threshold.
</p>

<img src="images/0543/rn_543_11.png" alt="RN_543 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">writeFile()</span> method writes events for a single height to a file. The events are sorted
    on timestamp, and vote totals for each hash are written at the end of the file. To conserve space, individual votes
    are not written when voting for a block is unanimous. In cases where consensus is not unanimous, this file could be
    used to make a graph showing how voting evolves over time, and it should provide some interesting insight into the
    consensus process.
</p>

<img src="images/0543/rn_543_12.png" alt="RN_543 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">getUsableSpace()</span> method checks for usable storage space in the destination folder. If
    the actual space cannot be determined, a value of <span content="code">0</span> is returned, which will cause the
    <span class="code">ConsensusTracker</span> to terminate if the threshold is set to any value greater than
    <span class="code">0</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0543/rn_543_13.png" alt="RN_543 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 300px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">PrintUtil</span>, a compact version of <span class="code">printTimestamp()</span> has been
    added for use in the consensus-tracker files.
</p>

<img src="images/0543/rn_543_14.png" alt="RN_543 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 340px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">SentinelController</span>, the new block string replaces the block height in the display.
</p>
