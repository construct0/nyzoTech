<h1>Nyzo 534: message queue priming</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 534
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/18a3c74f78c107e15e39aa863edfed6cbf47953b"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds priming of the message queue in
    <span class="code">HashVoteOverrideRequestScript</span> to avoid triggering replay attack protection due to
    initialization delays.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects <span class="code">HashVoteOverrideRequestScript</span> only.
</p>

<p>
    In some environments, there is a significant delay in sending the first message after program initialization. This
    delay can be so long that it causes a message to be rejected due to replay protection, as the timestamp of the
    message is based on when the message is created, not when it is sent. To overcome this, a method has been added to
    send a dummy message to the loopback address to prime the message system.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">HashVoteOverrideRequestScript</span>, the new
    <span class="code">ScriptUtil.primeMessageQueue()</span> method is called before any other messages are sent.

<p>
    The <span class="code">primeMessageQueue()</span> method sends a <span class="code">Ping200</span> message to the
    loopback IP address (<span class="code">127.0.0.1</span>). It does not matter whether a socket is listening on the
    Nyzo port at this address. If a response is received, it is discarded. The action of sending a message, regardless
    of how simple, causes all necessary initialization to occur and prevents initialization delays when subsequent
    messages are sent.
