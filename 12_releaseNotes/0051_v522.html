<h1>Nyzo 522: balance manager rework</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 522
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/b58b26070cb8620c22f355b003bd3f664833de83"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) reworks <span class="code">BalanceManager</span> to be more efficient,
    more robust, and easier to understand.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects both the verifier and the sentinel. They both use the <span class="code">BalanceManager</span>
    class.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BalanceListManager</span>, the <span class="code">totalQueries</span> and
    <span class="code">totalWork</span> fields have been eliminated. These fields provided insight into the amount of
    computation required to produce balance lists in the previous code. This was especially important for understanding
    the typical computation required for servicing incoming requests. This version eliminates derivation of balance
    lists due to incoming requests and places strict limits on the work required to produce balance lists for other
    purposes, so these fields are no longer required.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">retentionEdgeList</span> and <span class="code">frozenEdgeList</span> fields have been
    replaced with <span class="code">recentLists</span>.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">accountSetHeight</span> field has been removed. The new process for updating the account set
    is performed each time the frozen edge changes.
</p>

<p>
    The balance-list map has been changed to a concurrent map to improve thread safety.
</p>

<img src="images/0522/rn_522_3.png" alt="RN_522 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 451px;">

<p>
    A new method, <span class="code">recentBalanceListForHeight()</span>, has been added to provide balance lists for
    block requests. The eliminates the possibility of spikes in computational load due to such requests asking for
    lists that are costly to derive. This method will return a balance list if one for the specified height is
    already available. Otherwise, it will return <span class="code">null</span>.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">balanceListForBlock()</span> method has been simplified and limited in what balance lists it
    will produce. If the requested balance list is for the Genesis block or is a saved balance list near the frozen
    edge, the balance list is always returned. Otherwise, the balance list is only produced if the frozen-edge balance
    list has not been set or if the requested list is one block past the frozen edge.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">registerBalanceList()</span> method now strictly limits the size of the balance-list map.
    In future versions, this limiting will be refined to keep the balance lists most likely to be used again, but the
    important consideration now is imposing a limit, no matter how indiscriminate, to ensure that the balance-list
    map does not grow unbounded.
</p>

<img src="images/0522/rn_522_6.png" alt="RN_522 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 545px;">

<p>
    Generation of the <span class="code">accountsInSystem</span> set and updating of the frozen-edge list have been
    moved from this method to the <span class="code">updateFrozenEdge()</span> method.
</p>

<img src="images/0522/rn_522_7.png" alt="RN_522 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">cleanMap()</span> method has been replaced with <span class="code">updateFrozenEdge()</span>.
    This method still clears the map of balance lists, but it only adds the frozen-edge list back to the map. The
    Genesis list was unnecessary, and balance lists derived from the retention-edge list were typically too costly. The
    new method also generates the <span class="code">accountsInSystem</span> set and pushes the frozen edge list to the
    <span class="code">recentLists</span> queue.
</p>

<img src="images/0522/rn_522_8.png" alt="RN_522 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 427px;">

<p>
    You will notice that all invocations of the <span class="code">BlockManager.balanceListForBlock()</span> method
    have changed due to removal of the <span class="code">StringBuilder</span> argument. This was used at one point for
    debugging, but it has been unused for quite some time.
</p>

<img src="images/0522/rn_522_9.png" alt="RN_522 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 443px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager</span>, the new <span class="code">BalanceListManager.updateFrozenEdge()</span>
    method is called in the initialization method and when a block is frozen. Also, loading of the trailing-edge
    balance list has been removed, as the balance-list manager no longer attempts to derive balance lists behind the
    frozen edge.
</p>

<img src="images/0522/rn_522_10.png" alt="RN_522 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 532px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManagerMap</span>, the call to <span class="code">BalanceListManager.cleanMap()</span>
    has been removed, because that method has been replaced with
    <span class="code">BalanceListManager.updateFrozenEdge()</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0522/rn_522_11.png" alt="RN_522 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 382px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Transaction</span>, <span class="code">BalanceManager.getFrozenEdgeList()</span> is now used
    to get the frozen-edge balance list. This eliminates a nested conditional statement in the code, which is why this
    small change affects so many lines.
</p>

<img src="images/0522/rn_522_12.png" alt="RN_522 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 545px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Verifier</span>, the <span class="code">rejoinCount</span> field has been removed. It was
    used to track how often a node detected that it was no longer receiving messages and needed to send new node-join
    messages to reestablish connection to the mesh. The rejoin mechanism was replaced long ago by the continuous
    reconnection process that sends a small number of node-join messages after each block is frozen, and this counter
    has been unused since then.
</p>

<img src="images/0522/rn_522_13.png" alt="RN_522 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 230px;">

<p>
    A field has been added for initialization time. This will likely be added to the private version of the status
    response in a later version.
</p>

<img src="images/0522/rn_522_14.png" alt="RN_522 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 480px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockResponse</span>, use of
    <span class="code">BalanceListManager.balanceListForBlock()</span> has been replaced with
    <span class="code">BalanceListManager.recentBalanceListForHeight()</span> to ensure that balance lists are not
    derived due to incoming requests.
</p>
