<h1>Nyzo 583: CORS for client API</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 583
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/205cd6a9b6ff385d6658cde5fea7061212545cc0"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds the <span class="code">Access-Control-Allow-Origin=*</span> header to
    the client API endpoints to allow cross-origin access.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the API endpoints on the client only.
</p>

<p>
    This version is due to a <a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/issues/18" target="_blank">suggestion by a
    community member who opened an issue on GitHub</a>. We appreciate the suggestion, and we consider our failure to
    implement this to be a mistake that detracted from the intended functionality of the API endpoints on the client.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">CommandEndpointApi.getResponse()</span>, the
    <span class="code">Access-Control-Allow-Origin</span> header is now set with a value of <span class="code">*</span>.

    If you are disappointed by the brevity of these release notes, we invite you to revisit the release notes for
    <a href="v476">version 476</a>.
