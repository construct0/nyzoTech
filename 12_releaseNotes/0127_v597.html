<h1>Nyzo 597: cycle transaction script</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 597
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/9e6229ef8790a9989ac464addf7c2715c088872c"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds <span class="code">BlockManager</span> initialization to the
    <span class="code">CycleTransactionSignScript</span>.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version only affects <span class="code">CycleTransactionSignScript</span>.
</p>

<p>
    In <a href="v588">version 588</a>, initialization of <span class="code">BlockManager</span> was changed from a
    <span class="code">static</span> block in the class to a requirement that the
    <span class="code">BlockManager.initialize()</span> method be called manually. The release notes stated:
</p>

<p class="quote">
    Also, the <span class="code">static</span> block has been removed. <span class="emphasis">This is a significant,
    far-reaching change.</span> This change has been fully tested for the verifier, sentinel, and client, but it may
    still have some unintended effects on scripts. This will continue to be reviewed.
</p>

<p>
    One of the affected scripts is the <span class="code">CycleTransactionSignScript</span>. In this script,
    <span class="code">BlockManager</span> is now explicitly initialized.
