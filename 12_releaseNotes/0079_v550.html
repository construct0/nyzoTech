<h1>Nyzo 550: transaction limit</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 550
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/2ea08c5183f6cfed97984249ae78bd1be2961245"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds a variable per-block transaction limit to the block-assembly process.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the verifier. The code paths also involve the sentinel, but the behavior of the sentinel is not
    significantly affected.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BalanceManager</span>, a <span class="code">forBlockAssembly</span> argument has been added
    to the <span class="code">approvedTransactionsForBlock</span> method.
</p>

<p>
    In this method, if <span class="code">forBlockAssembly</span> is <span class="code">true</span>, a hard limit is
    placed on the number of transactions per block. This limit cannot be applied at this point for any case other than
    block assembly, because such application could interfere with the verifier or sentinel's ability to track the
    blockchain. When transactions must be removed, the smallest transactions are removed, leaving the larger
    transactions. Also, this process is applied after all other transaction-filtering processes. This eliminates
    potential manipulation by flooding a block with large, invalid transactions, and it also eliminates potential
    manipulation by flooding a block with small, valid transactions.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">balanceListForNextBlock()</span> method of <span class="code">Block</span>, a
    <span class="code">false</span> value is passed for the new argument to bypass limiting.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">setFrozenEdge()</span> method of <span class="code">BlockManager</span>, blocks are now
    registered with <span class="code">BlockchainMetricsManager</span>. This is a new class that provides efficient
    access to blockchain information.
</p>

<img src="images/0550/rn_550_3.png" alt="RN_550 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 400px;">

<p>
    The new <span class="code">BlockchainMetricsManager</span> class provides guidance on how many transactions should
    be included in the current block. The baseline rate is 10 transactions per second, which is 70 transactions per
    block. Each additional Nyzo in standard transactions, on average over the previous cycle, increases the block
    capacity by one transaction.
</p>

<p>
    At this point, it is worth noting that Nyzo was tested before release to support exceptionally high transaction
    rates &mdash; more than a hundred times the baseline rate. While these tests were run on a small testnet, a larger
    cycle does not negatively affect transaction processing capacity. A larger cycle does tend to place higher
    computational demands on verifiers, but those demands are not proportional to block size. In fact, the predictable
    nature of which verifier will likely be responsible for each block makes a larger cycle an asset with respect to
    sustained transaction throughput.
</p>

<p>
    In short: <span class="emphasis">do not misinterpret the low baseline rate as a sign that Nyzo cannot support
    significantly higher transaction rates</span>. The baseline rate is simply a protection to keep verification
    profitable for verifiers. The ability to support larger blocks and higher transaction rates is mostly dependent on
    the computing capacity of verifiers, and this ensures that verifiers will not be forced to upgrade to more robust
    hardware to deal with huge, brief spikes in transactions or sustained periods of miniscule transactions.

<p>
    The <span class="code">registerBlock()</span> method updates the <span class="code">cycleTransactionSum</span> and
    <span class="code">cycleLength</span> from the provided block. This is called from the
    <span class="code">setFrozenEdge()</span> method of <span class="code">BlockManager</span>. While a full
    recalculation of the cycle sum from the map, superficially, seems inefficient, the combination of the map cleanup
    with the cycle sum calculation makes the process remarkably efficient. Also, avoidance of the use of a running sum
    eliminates the need to deal with complications due to skipped block heights.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">standardTransactionSum()</span> helper method is used to improve readability of the
    <span class="code">registerBlock()</span> method. Only standard transactions are considered in the cycle sum
    calculation.
</p>

<img src="images/0550/rn_550_6.png" alt="RN_550 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 390px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteManager</span>, feedback has been improved when the calculated verifier is
    <span class="code">null</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0550/rn_550_7.png" alt="RN_550 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 570px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">RunMode.setRunMode()</span>, a log statement to the error stream has been added. This will be
    helpful when reviewing that stream to determine in what versions of the software errors occurred.
</p>

<img src="images/0550/rn_550_8.png" alt="RN_550 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager</span>, the maps created for individual heights have been changed to
    their concurrent versions. This is related to the previous change in <span class="code">RunMode</span>. Previously,
    the <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.registerBlock()</span> method was intermittently throwing a
    <span class="code">ConcurrentModificationException</span>. The delineation of versions in the error log will allow
    easy determination of whether this exception continues to be thrown now that these maps are concurrent.
</p>

<img src="images/0550/rn_550_9.png" alt="RN_550 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Verifier</span>, a <span class="code">true</span> value is provided for the
    <span class="code">forBlockAssembly</span> argument of the
    <span class="code">BalanceManager.approvedTransactionsForBlock()</span> method. This argument activates the new
    transaction-limiting functionality.
</p>

<img src="images/0550/rn_550_10.png" alt="RN_550 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Sentinel</span>, also, a <span class="code">true</span> value is provided for the
    <span class="code">forBlockAssembly</span> argument of the
    <span class="code">BalanceManager.approvedTransactionsForBlock</span> method. This argument is inconsequential in
    an unmodified sentinel, as the sentinel should never have more than one transaction per block (the seed
    transaction).
</p>

<img src="images/0550/rn_550_11.png" alt="RN_550 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 520px;">

<p>
    The remaining changes are minor modifications that were added to support the new web wallet. They do not
    significantly affect the verifier or sentinel.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">PrintUtil</span>, convenience methods have been added for printing Nyzo string identifiers.
</p>

<img src="images/0550/rn_550_12.png" alt="RN_550 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 470px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">HtmlElementList</span>, the argument is now returned from the <span class="code">add()</span>
    method to allow for method chaining. This parallels the <span class="code">HtmlTag.add()</span> method.
</p>

<img src="images/0550/rn_550_13.png" alt="RN_550 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 300px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">HtmlTag</span>, a <span class="code">getAttr()</span> method has been added. This is useful
    for modifying an attribute, as the <span class="code">attr()</span> method replaces the previous value.
</p>

<img src="images/0550/rn_550_14.png" alt="RN_550 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 250px;">

<p>
    Multiple tests were performed with <span class="verifier-name">Argo 746</span> running version 550 and
    <span class="verifier-name">Argo 752</span> running version 546. When 100 transactions were sent to
    <span class="verifier-name">Argo 752</span>, they were all incorporated (blocks
    <a href="https://nyzo.co/blockPlain/5046422" target="_blank">5046422</a> and
    <a href="https://nyzo.co/blockPlain/5059533" target="_blank">5059533</a>). When 100 transactions were sent
    to <span class="verifier-name">Argo 746</span>, the smaller transactions were eliminated (blocks
    <a href="https://nyzo.co/blockPlain/5056081" target="_blank">5056081</a> and
    <a href="https://nyzo.co/blockPlain/5058997" target="_blank">5058997</a>). The earlier block had 2 additional
    transactions above baseline due to the presence of a total of &cap;3,487.820344 in standard transactions in the
    preceding cycle.
