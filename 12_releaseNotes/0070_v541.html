<h1>Nyzo 541: join process</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 541
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/36666cae0ace8a33368d54e1f9aca7d8d19c0625"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) includes improvements to the join process and some minor bug fixes.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version primarily affects the verifier.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Block.chainScore()</span>, the calculation for a new verifier has been modified. Instead of
    a ranking of top new verifiers, only a single top verifier is now assigned a score that allows joining. Previously,
    the second-place new verifier would have a score of 2, which would sometimes allow joining if the top new verifier
    did not transmit a block and the in-cycle verifier with a score of 0 was delayed in transmitting its block.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager</span>, only the single top verifier is now added to
    <span class="code">currentAndNearCycleSet</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0541/rn_541_1.png" alt="RN_541 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 400px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockVoteManager</span>, <span class="code">votesForHeight</span> and
    <span class="code">flipVotesForHeight</span> are now <span class="code">ConcurrentHashMap</span> objects. This
    improves thread safety.
</p>

<img src="images/0541/rn_541_2.png" alt="RN_541 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 450px;">

<p>
    Synchronization has been removed from the <span class="code">votesAtHeight()</span> method. This method was using
    synchronization to prevent problems with accessing the <span class="code">votesForHeight</span> map. As that map is
    now a concurrency-safe object, synchronization is no longer required.
</p>

<p>
    Also, the logic for counting votes has been simplified by replacing use of the map's <span class="code">get()</span>
    method with use of the <span class="code">getOrDefault()</span> method.
</p>

<img src="images/0541/rn_541_3.png" alt="RN_541 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 380px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">votesForHeight()</span> method, the map for the requested height is now returned without
    copying. While returning copies of private, mutable objects is discouraged in object-oriented design, the
    performance impact of creating copies is non-negligible in this case.
</p>

<p>
    Also of note regarding this method: error logs on verifiers infrequently showed a
    <span class="code">ConcurrentModificationException</span> being thrown in the creation of the
    <span class="code">HashMap</span> copy in this method when creating a
    <span class="code">BlockWithVotesResponse</span>. While the elimination of this copy would only shift the possible
    location of this exception, the use of a <span class="code">ConcurrentHashMap</span> to store votes at each height
    has eliminated the problem.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">LockedAccountManager.isSubjectToLock()</span>, transactions of
    <span class="code">typeCoinGeneration</span> are now explicitly excluded from locking. Such transactions are only
    allowed to occur in the Genesis block, and they would never be subject to locking. These transactions do not have
    sender identifiers, which was causing a null-pointer exception to be thrown in this method. This was interfering
    with the initialization process of new verifiers.
</p>

<img src="images/0541/rn_541_5.png" alt="RN_541 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">topVerifiers()</span> method, which returned a ranked list of verifiers, has been replaced
    with a <span class="code">topVerifier()</span> method, which returns either a single verifier identifier or
    <span class="code">null</span>. A verifier will be returned only if it has votes from more than half of the current
    cycle. The join process was originally designed to fill available cycle positions as quickly as possible, even if
    that meant allowing non-preferred verifiers to join. This modification acknowledges the current reality that the
    number of verifiers wishing to join the cycle far exceeds available entry positions.
</p>

<p>
    The addition of this verifier to the list in the absence of another verifier is an archaic compensation for poor
    messaging in the early development process. It is no longer necessary or helpful. Logging statements have been
    added to display the chosen verifier. When a verifier is chosen, the number of votes for that verifier is displayed
    both as a count and as a percentage of the current cycle.
</p>

<p>
    The constructor of <span class="code">BootstrapResponseV2</span> has been rewritten to avoid possible null-pointer
    exceptions. While these were uncommon, they were observed on running verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">MeshStatusResponse</span> has been updated to reflect the new single-verifier result produced
    by <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteManager</span>.

<p>
    For the suggestion that the new-verifier entry should require a majority,
    <a href="https://client.nyzo.co/transactionSearch?timestamp=1565719609531&action=run" target="_blank">
        &cap;20,000 was awarded to 219f...0183</a>. This bounty will be deducted from the funds held by the Nyzo team,
    and it will not affect the amount of funds that will be transferred to the cycle account.
