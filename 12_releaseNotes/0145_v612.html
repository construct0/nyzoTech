<h1>Nyzo 612: sentinel warning for unhealthy verifiers</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 612
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/a127e2cba6522da5b11cd13d1c61a0fec8ce5f85"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds a sentinel indication when a verifier is suspected to be unhealthy.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the sentinel only.
</p>

<p>
    While <a href="https://nyzo.co" target="_blank">the Nyzo website</a> has long displayed suspected verifier-health
    issues, the sentinel did not offer a similar indication. In the interest of improving decentralization of health
    monitoring, this version adds a sentinel indication when a verifier appears to be having difficult tracking the
    blockchain.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">frozenEdgeHeight</span> field was added to the <span class="code">ManagedVerifier</span>
    class to allow comparison of the verifier's frozen edge to the sentinel's frozen edge.
</p>

<p>
    Accessor and mutator methods for the new field were added, and the <span class="code">possiblyUnhealthy()</span>
    method was added to provide a consistent determination of whether a verifier's health is of concern.
</p>

<p>
    In the sentinel's run loop for a verifier, an update of the frozen edge is now performed whenever the results
    returned by regular block requests do not provide enough information to ensure that the verifier is properly
    tracking the blockchain.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Sentinel.updateBlocks()</span>, the frozen edge of the verifier is now advanced based on the
    blocks it returns.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">Sentinel.updateFrozenEdge()</span> method gets the frozen edge of a
    <span class="code">ManagedVerifier</span> by sending a <span class="code">StatusRequest17</span> message and
    extracting the frozen edge from the <span class="code">StatusResponse</span>. While this is not elegant, it is the
    most efficient way to get the frozen edge height of a verifier, and it did not require the addition of a new
    message type.
</p>

<img src="images/0612/rn_612_4.png" alt="RN_612 image 4" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 390px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">SentinelController.verifierTable()</span>, a CSS class was added to indicate an unhealthy
    verifier with the label. Classes were also added to color-code the tiles, replacing the inline CSS previously
    applied to the tiles.
</p>

<p>
    If a verifier's health is in question, the <span class="code">verifier-label-unhealthy</span> CSS class is applied.
</p>

<img src="images/0612/rn_612_6.png" alt="RN_612 image 6" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 110px;">

<p>
    The following image shows the sentinel interface with this new functionality. Because
    <span class="verifier-name">&#x26f5; Argo 2080</span> has not provided blocks recently, its health is in question.
    The status request, which updates the verifier's frozen edge without requesting a block, would suppress this warning
    if <span class="verifier-name">&#x26f5; Argo 2080</span> provides a response indicating that its frozen edge is
    close to the sentinel's frozen edge.
</p>

<p>
    Tile classes are now used instead of colors. This does not change the appearance of the page. It only improves the
    quality of the HTML.
