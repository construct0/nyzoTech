<h1>Nyzo 539: TCP connection limiting</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 539
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/c358bfda1523c0a107bf4fcf42719c9f58bc7487"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) improves management of TCP connections to better constrain memory usage.
</p>


<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects all run modes of Nyzo.
</p>

<p>
    Nyzo is a communication-heavy system. To eliminate the potential problems associated with maintaining open
    connections within the mesh, a new connection is established for every message. Some of these connections were not
    closing properly, and many more were consuming excess memory in a 60-second <span class="code">TIME_WAIT</span>
    state due to how they were closed. Contrary to some suggestions that this <span class="code">TIME_WAIT</span> state
    is adjustable on Linux, the 60-second wait is actually hard-coded in the Linux kernel and cannot be reduced without
    compiling a custom kernel.
</p>

<p>
    The suggestions floating around online that actually reduce the number of connections in
    <span class="code">TIME_WAIT</span> are effective because they modify other parameters, but the
    <span class="code">net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout</span> variable <span class="emphasis">does not change</span> the
    <span class="code">TIME_WAIT</span> timeout. The confusion is due to the way these are defined in
    <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/net/tcp.h" target="_blank">
        <span class="filename">tcp.h</span></a> in the Linux source:
</p>

<p class="code">
    #define TCP_TIMEWAIT_LEN (60*HZ)<br>
    #define TCP_FIN_TIMEOUT	TCP_TIMEWAIT_LEN
</p>

<p>
    The default value of <span class="code">tcp_fin_timeout</span>, defined here, is set to the same value as
    <span class="code">tcp_timewait_len</span>. However, the value of <span class="code">tcp_fin_timeout</span>, which
    is an adjustable parameter, does not propagate back to <span class="code">tcp_timewait_len</span>.
</p>

<p>
    So, we are left with a timeout that cannot be adjusted and an accumulation of connections that is sometimes causing
    performance and stability issues. While there are some system adjustments that could partially address this problem,
    this version addresses it directly by forcing connections to close in a way that avoids the
    <span class="code">TIME_WAIT</span> state. The technique used here is unconventional, and it is not a good
    general-purpose solution to the <span class="code">TIME_WAIT</span> problem, but it fits well with the
    design of Nyzo. Also, it drastically improves the performance and stability of Nyzo.
</p>

<p>
    The new <span class="code">Connection</span> class wraps a <span class="code">Socket</span> and a timestamp.

<p>
    <span class="code">ConnectionManager</span> is a simple FIFO queue of <span class="code">Connection</span> objects.
    It provides a process for terminating connections after a specified delay while only using a single thread and
    minimal computational power. The delay is necessary because the abrupt termination now used for sockets can cause
    information loss if it is executed too quickly after the last data is written to the socket output stream.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">slowCloseSocket()</span> method attempts to add a socket to the termination queue, closing
    the socket immediately if addition to the queue fails. In practice, the socket will almost always (or always) be
    added to the queue. Immediately closing a socket, with the consequent risk of loss of transmitted information, is
    preferable to leaking a socket or expending extra effort to close the socket more gently.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">fastCloseSocket()</span> method is the essence of this version, and it is an unconventional
    solution. Activating <span class="code">SO_LINGER</span> with a timeout of <span class="code">0</span> bypasses the
    normal TCP termination process. If you read even a little about this setting, you will find some strong opinions
    about it. In reality, the need to use this setting indicates that TCP is not the ideal protocol for Nyzo. In the
    future, Nyzo will likely be well served migrating to a UDP-based protocol that segments and reassembles messages at
    the application level to overcome transport-level limitations. Fundamentally, Nyzo is a message-oriented system,
    not a connection-oriented system.

<p>
    In <span class="code">MeshListener</span>, the <span class="code">close()</span> method calls on blacklisted
    connections now use <span class="code">ConnectionManager.fastCloseSocket()</span>.
</p>

<p>
    A comment was added to the <span class="code">readMessageAndRespond()</span> method call to make the code easier to
    understand.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">readMessageAndRespond()</span>, the output stream is flushed after the response message is
    written to it. This ensures that the response message is pushed through any application-level buffering that is in
    place.
</p>

<img src="images/0539/rn_539_6.png" alt="RN_539 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 450px;">

<p>
    At the end of the <span class="code">readMessageAndRespond()</span> method, the socket is closed with the
    <span class="code">ConnectionManager.slowCloseSocket()</span> method. This method attempts to give the connection
    time to transmit the response before forcing the socket to close.
</p>

<img src="images/0539/rn_539_7.png" alt="RN_539 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 300px;">

<p>
    The connection timeout for outgoing connections has been reduced from 3 seconds to 2 seconds. The 3-second timeout
    was excessively long. The socket close in case of an exception when opening the socket has been replaced with a call
    to <span class="code">ConnectionManager.fastCloseSocket()</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0539/rn_539_8.png" alt="RN_539 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 440px;">

<p>
    A timeout of 1 second was added for reading responses to outgoing messages. Without this timeout, an attacker or a
    malfunctioning verifier could keep many connections open indefinitely, consuming resources on this system.
</p>

<img src="images/0539/rn_539_9.png" alt="RN_539 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    The implementation of <span class="code">ThreadUtil.sleep()</span> has been modified to handle negative inputs more
    reasonably. This does not significantly change the behavior of the code, but it is more sensible than the previous
    implementation.
