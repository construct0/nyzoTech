<h1>Nyzo 481: status response</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 481
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/b73bc25ba3094abe3470ec070ce306885ad9a18f"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) updates the <span class="code">StatusResponse</span> on the verifier.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version does not alter behavior of the verifier or the sentinel. It is for monitoring purposes only. To
    prepare for upcoming improvements in memory usage, we wanted to add memory usage to the status response. While
    adding memory usage, some other improvements were also made to the status response.
</p>

<p>
    Certain information in the status response might be useful for an attacker trying to disable a verifier, so the
    <span class="code">StatusResponse</span> constructor was given an additional parameter to allow it to determine
    whether an incoming request is self-signed.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">MeshListener</span> class provides this parameter using the source-node identifier from
    incoming messages. The mesh listener only builds a response to messages for which the signature is valid, and the
    source-node identifier is used to check the signature, so the source-node identifier cannot be spoofed.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">StatusResponse</span> constructor checks the identifier, and certain fields are now provided
    only when the identifier matches the verifier's identifier. These fields are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>new timestamp (age in milliseconds of the second timestamp in a circular queue of recent message timestamps)
    </li>
    <li>old timestamp (age in milliseconds of the oldest timestamp in a circular queue of recent message timestamps;
        this and new timestamp provide a general idea of message load on the verifier, with smaller numbers
        indicating a higher message load and larger numbers indicating a lower message load)</li>
    <li>blocks (block manager map information)</li>
    <li>balance lists (balance manager map information)</li>
    <li>memory usage (<span class="emphasis">new</span>; approximate memory usage of the application)</li>
    <li>threshold overrides, if set (manual threshold overrides for block consensus)</li>
    <li>hash overrides, if set (manual hash overrides for block consensus)</li>
    <li>notification budget, if notifications are enabled (remaining notifications budget according to the
        leaky bucket algorithm used in <span class="code">NotificationUtil</span>)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The <span class="code">extraFields</span> map has been removed. It was only being used for the notification budget
    and the <span class="code">S/U/L</span> (supported/unsupported/legacy) field that was put in place to monitor
    adoption of the <span class="code">BlockWithVotesRequest37</span> message. The notification budget field is now set
    explicitly in the <span class="code">StatusResponse</span> constructor, and the <span class="code">S/U/L</span>
    field was removed because it is no longer necessary due to widespread adoption of the
    <span class="code">BlockWithVotesRequest37</span> message.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">StatusRequestScript</span> has also been modified to support fetching of the privileged form
    of that status response. In addition to the older, IP-based invocation of this script, it can now be run by
    providing the private seed of the verifier to query. The IP will be fetched from the mesh in this case, as in the
    other scripts that require a private seed, and the message will be signed with the private seed provided.
</p>

<img src="images/0481/rn_481_4.png" alt="RN_481 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 496px; max-height: 356px;">

<p>
    From the verifier directory, after you download and build the Nyzo code, the script can be run with an IP address
    like this:
</p>

<p class="code">
    java -jar build/libs/nyzoVerifier-1.0.jar co.nyzo.verifier.scripts.StatusRequestScript 54.190.16.83
</p>

<p>
    In this case, the output will be similar to this:
</p>

<p class="code">
    nickname: Argo 746<br>
    version: 481<br>
    ID: c34a...7af5<br>
    mesh: 1268 active, 2 inactive<br>
    cycle length: 466<br>
    transactions: 0<br>
    retention edge: 1391621<br>
    trailing edge: 1391645<br>
    frozen edge: 1393507 (hel1-26)<br>
    open edge: 1393507<br>
    blocks transmitted/created: 1/28<br>
    votes requested: 467<br>
</p>

<p>
    The script can be run with a private seed like this:
</p>

<p class="command">
    java -jar build/libs/nyzoVerifier-1.0.jar co.nyzo.verifier.scripts.StatusRequestScript
    0123456701234567-0123456701234567-0123456701234567-0123456701234567
</p>

<p>
    In this case, the output will be similar to this, with the privileged fields included:
</p>

<p class="command">
