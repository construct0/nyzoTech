<h1>Nyzo 575: v2 cycle tx commands</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 575
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/c8e254a47f1c86e894d02742a6180940e8924524"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) modifies the client cycle transaction commands for blockchain version 2.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the client only.
</p>

<p>
    When blockchain updates are made, the core code that handles processing of blocks and balance lists must retain
    knowledge of prior blockchain versions. While this is not necessary for verifiers that are building the blockchain,
    it is necessary for the client and for anyone wanting to use the code to work with the historical blockchain.
</p>

<p>
    However, the client commands that interact with the cycle do not need legacy functionality. The blockchain has
    successfully updated to version 2, so client commands for versions less than 2 no longer have any usefulness.
</p>

<p>
    This version updates the client commands for cycle transactions to support version 2 of the blockchain, replacing
    the commands for equivalent functionality in version 1 of the blockchain.
</p>

<p>
    The changes in the <span class="code">Block</span> class are inconsequential. Indentation was corrected, a line of
    whitespace was added to improve readability, and <span class="code">blockHeight</span> was added to a print
    statement.
</p>

<p>
    A comment was added to <span class="code">MeshListener</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_1.png" alt="RN_575 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 360px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Transaction.getByteSize()</span>, a confusing reassignment of <span class="code">size</span>
    was eliminated to improve code readability.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_2.png" alt="RN_575 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 350px; max-height: 210px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">ClientTransactionUtil.sendTransactionToLikelyBlockVerifiers()</span>, the identifier and IP
    address are now displayed for null responses. Also, the wait for a block to be received is now limited to 30
    seconds, and periodic feedback is now provided.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_3.png" alt="RN_575 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 300px;">

<p>
    The version 2 blockchain allows for a much simpler <span class="code">CycleTransactionListCommand</span>. An
    in-cycle verifier key is no longer required to fetch pending transactions. Pending cycle transactions are now stored
    in the balance list. This command no longer accepts any arguments, so validation is no longer required.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_4.png" alt="RN_575 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 380px;">

<p>
    The command is not long running now, and the validation logic was eliminated.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_5.png" alt="RN_575 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 470px; max-height: 390px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">CycleTransactionListCommand.run()</span>, querying of the list of cycle transactions was
    removed.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_6.png" alt="RN_575 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 400px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">CycleTransactionListCommand</span> now produces an immediate result, so it now uses a
    <span class="code">CommandTable</span> to present the result. The table is made and headers are added. The
    <span class="code">BalanceList</span> of the frozen edge is retrieved. An error is added if the balance list cannot
    be retrieved, and a notice is added if the balance list contains no pending cycle transactions.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">CycleTransactionManager</span> is no longer used by the client, so the call to
    <span class="code">CycleTransactionManager.performMaintenance()</span> was eliminated. All of the old code for
    building the output table from the local list was removed in favor of code that builds a table from the cycle
    transactions stored in the balance list.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_7.png" alt="RN_575 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 480px;">

<p>
    A notice is added with the height and distance from open edge of the balance list used. A row is added for each
    pending cycle transaction.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_8.png" alt="RN_575 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 310px;">

<p>
    A <span class="code">SimpleExecutionResult</span> is returned from the
    <span class="code">CycleTransactionListCommand.run()</span> method. This provides good support for both the web
    interface and API.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_9.png" alt="RN_575 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 270px; max-height: 40px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">CycleTransactionListCommand.processResponse()</span> method was used to register transactions
    from the <span class="code">TransactionListResponse</span>. It is no longer needed.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_10.png" alt="RN_575 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 160px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">CycleTransactionListCommand.getTransactionList()</span> was removed. Cycle transactions are now
    available as a consistently ordered list inside the balance list.
    <span class="code">CycleTransactionListCommand.numberOfYesVotes()</span> provides the count of affirmative votes for
    each transaction. Verifiers may change their vote for a transaction at any time before approval, and affirmative and
    negative votes are both allowed.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_11.png" alt="RN_575 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 310px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">blockHeight</span> argument was removed from
    <span class="code">CycleTransactionSendCommand</span>. Previously, cycle transactions were scheduled far in advance
    so that signatures could be collected and bundled with the transaction in the target block. Now, cycle transactions
    are included without signatures, and signatures are registered in later blocks.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_12.png" alt="RN_575 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 170px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">CycleTransactionSendCommand.validate()</span>, validation of
    <span class="code">blockHeight</span> was removed.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_13.png" alt="RN_575 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 140px;">

<p>
    Removal of the <span class="code">blockHeight</span> argument in
    <span class="code">CycleTransactionSendCommand.validate()</span> caused later argument indices to shift back by one
    position.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_14.png" alt="RN_575 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 370px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">CycleTransactionSendCommand.run()</span> now sends the transaction to likely block verifiers
    only, not to the entire cycle. The <span class="code">ClientTransactionUtil.suggestedTransactionTimestamp()</span>
    method is the same method used to choose a timestamp for standard transactions.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_15.png" alt="RN_575 code 15" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 300px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">CycleTransactionSignCommand</span> now accepts a transaction signature in lieu of an index. It
    also now accepts a vote, <span class="code">1</span> to vote for the transaction or <span class="code">0</span> to
    vote against the transaction. A vote against the transaction does not affect approval except when it is used to
    revoke a prior vote for the transaction.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_16.png" alt="RN_575 code 16" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">CycleTransactionSignCommand.validate()</span>, the transaction list is no longer needed, and
    the index is no longer provided. The signature is only checked to be a valid Nyzo signature string.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_17.png" alt="RN_575 code 17" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 340px;">

<p>
    The logic checking the signer key is unchanged. This is an indentation change.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_18.png" alt="RN_575 code 18" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 230px;">

<p>
    The vote is required to be <span class="code">1</span> or <span class="code">0</span>. The transaction is no longer
    retrieved from a list, so transaction properties are no longer displayed.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_19.png" alt="RN_575 code 19" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 250px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">CycleTransactionSignCommand.run()</span>, the arguments are retrieved, the cycle-signature
    transaction is built, and the transaction is sent to likely verifiers. Like cycle transactions, cycle-signature
    transactions are now included in the blockchain immediately, so the transaction does not need to be sent to the
    entire cycle.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_20.png" alt="RN_575 code 20" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 240px;">

<p>
    A misspelling was corrected in <span class="code">SentinelController</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0575/rn_575_21.png" alt="RN_575 code 21" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 110px;">
