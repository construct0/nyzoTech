<h1>Nyzo release notes, version 474</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 474
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/000211ef0372ad1d82855f0bc3c9a5976028d3e5"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) corrects two issues that were causing the verifier initialization
    process to be unnecessarily slow.
</p>

<p>
    On the official Nyzo verifiers, all AWS t3.micro instances, the time between restarting the verifier process
    and the verifier responding reliably to messages had climbed to over 3 minutes. Some users also reported failures
    when restarting their verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    The first correction is a simple addition of some blocks loaded from a consolidated file into the
    <span class="code">BlockManagerMap</span>. Such manual additions to the map should be done with care, especially
    after initialization, due to potential side effects. In this case, though, the manual addition was necessary due to
    the proceeding <span class="code">setFrozenEdge(block)</span> method invocation.

<p>
    To understand why this is necessary, we must look at the
    <span class="code">setFrozenEdge()</span> method implementation. In this method, the cycle information is used
    (<span class="code">block.getCycleInformation().getDeterminationHeight()</span>). To create the cycle information
    object, the code steps back several cycles into the blockchain, one block at a time. So, instead of using the blocks
    that we had just loaded from the consolidated file, the code was reading one block at a time, often from a
    consolidated file containing 1000 blocks, for several cycles.

<p>
    The other issue is more obvious. In the <span class="code">loadBalanceListFromFileForHeight()</span> method, balance
    lists from consolidated files were loaded but not assigned to the <span class="code">balanceList</span>
    variable. This resulted in many unnecessary file reads and additional work to derive the balance list from an
    earlier list.
