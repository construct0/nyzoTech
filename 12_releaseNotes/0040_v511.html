<h1>Nyzo 511: UDP voting activated</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 511
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/ae33b6333350270cab449731790e2a6a1eb8cef6"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) improves the accuracy of the scoring system by introducing a one-block
    delay between freezing blocks and counting block votes. It also activates UDP sending of block votes and improves
    performance of the thread that receives UDP messages.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects only the verifier. The sentinel does not maintain performance scores, and it does not send
    or receive block votes.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlacklistManager</span>, an overload of the <span class="code">inBlacklist()</span> method
    has been added to accept a <span class="code">ByteBuffer</span> directly. The old overload of the method wraps the
    <span class="code">byte</span> array argument and uses the new overload.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">registerVote()</span> method of <span class="code">BlockVoteManager</span> now accepts
    votes at the current frozen edge.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">MeshListener</span>, the single <span class="code">byte</span> array packet buffer has been
    replaced with a queue of 50000 pre-constructed <span class="code">DatagramPacket</span> instances.
</p>

<p>
    In the TCP socket loop, the condition for sleeping when the verifier is paused has been removed. This was a testing
    mechanism that was never fully implemented, so this does not change any behavior.
</p>

<img src="images/0511/rn_511_3.png" alt="RN_511 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 465px;">

<p>
    The UDP read socket has been updated to only read the incoming packet and store it in the processing queue. If the
    processing queue is full, the packet is discarded.
</p>

<img src="images/0511/rn_511_4.png" alt="RN_511 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 534px;">

<p>
    A new thread has been added for processing UDP packets. Some simple checks are implemented to avoid unnecessary
    work for packets that are superficially useless, but the small size of the packets keeps processing overhead low
    in all cases.
</p>

<img src="images/0511/rn_511_5.png" alt="RN_511 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 513px;">

<p>
    When pings or UDP block votes are received, the appropriate counters in the <span class="code">StatusResponse</span>
    class are incremented. These are temporary fields that will be removed in a few versions when the UDP code is
    reasonably well vetted.
</p>

<img src="images/0511/rn_511_6.png" alt="RN_511 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 527px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">Message.fromBytes()</span> method, the <span class="code">discardMessageLength</span>
    parameter has been renamed to <span class="code">isUdp</span>. In addition to discarding the message length from
    the buffer, this parameter is now used to determine if blacklisting should be avoided for this message. Source IP
    addresses can be spoofed for UDP messages, so IP-based blacklisting should not be used for these messages.
</p>

<img src="images/0511/rn_511_7.png" alt="RN_511 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 528px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">NodeManager</span> class, a lookup has been added to check if an IP address belongs to
    an in-cycle verifier. This is currently used only to check incoming UDP packets, but it will likely be used in a
    later version to improve performance of reading TCP messages, also.
</p>

<img src="images/0511/rn_511_8.png" alt="RN_511 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 454px;">

<p>
    Also in the <span class="code">NodeManager</span> class, version 2 node-join messages are now sent. This will
    activate UDP block votes for all verifiers.
</p>

<img src="images/0511/rn_511_9.png" alt="RN_511 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 547px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager</span>, the visibility of <span class="code">castVote()</span> has been
    changed to allow the <span class="code">Verifier</span> class to cast late votes to support performance scores.
</p>

<img src="images/0511/rn_511_10.png" alt="RN_511 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 367px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">Verifier</span> class, a vote is now cast when a block is frozen if the verifier has not
    yet cast a vote at the height that is being frozen. This is an uncommon occurrence, but it allows a verifier to
    take full advantage of the delayed performance-score tabulation.
</p>

<img src="images/0511/rn_511_11.png" alt="RN_511 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 548px;">

<p>
    Performance scores are now updated one block back from the block that was just frozen. This eliminates the
    possibility that minor timing issues would cause a verifier to be unfairly penalized.
</p>

<img src="images/0511/rn_511_12.png" alt="RN_511 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 474px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">VerifierPerformanceManager</span>, the increment has been changed to
    <span class="code">6</span> and the decrement to <span class="code">-7</span>. The total time that a verifier can
    be completely uninvolved in the mesh before receiving removal votes is still 2 days from 0, and the total credit
    that a verifier can earn for good performance is still an additional 2 days. However, the time required to earn that
    full credit is now 12 days, and a verifier now needs 6 days of good performance to make up for each day of no
    involvement.
</p>

<img src="images/0511/rn_511_13.png" alt="RN_511 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 544px;">

<p>
    The performance-score filename has been changed to version 3. This will reset all performance scores.
</p>

<img src="images/0511/rn_511_14.png" alt="RN_511 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 482px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">StatusResponse</span> class, some fields have been added for monitoring and testing the
    UDP functionality. Some or all of these will likely be removed in a later version.
</p>

<img src="images/0511/rn_511_15.png" alt="RN_511 code 15" class="code-image" style="width: 362px;">

<p>
    The hash of the frozen edge has also been added to the status response. There have been a number of cases where
    groups of out-of-cycle verifiers have stalled on a common block. One possible explanation for such a stall is
    freezing of an incorrect block on these verifiers. Inclusion of this field will allow easy confirmation or
    exclusion of this explanation.
</p>

<p>
    A bounty will be awarded for finding the issue of using spoofed UDP packets to cause a verifier to be blacklisted.
    The amount and transaction will be posted here shortly.
