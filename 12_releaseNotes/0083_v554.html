<h1>Nyzo 554: cycle transaction handling</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 554
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/835136c18d7fb331fdbb81c7f5f208f765af9125"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) improves cycle transaction handling.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the verifier. It also contains an insignificant change to HTML rendering that affects the
    documentation server.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">CycleTransactionManager.registerTransaction()</span> method, cycle transactions are now
    separated from their signatures before registration. This ensures that only valid, in-cycle signatures are
    added to the <span class="code">CycleTransactionManager</span>.
</p>

<p>
    This was not a security issue, because all cycle transaction signatures are also checked by the
    <span class="code">Verifier</span> class before block assembly and by the <span class="code">BalanceManager</span>
    in its <span class="code">enforceCycleTransactionRules()</span> method. But it could have allowed an attacker to
    cause the <span class="code">CycleTransactionManager</span> to store large numbers of invalid signatures, causing
    unnecessary memory usage.

<p>
    In <span class="code">Transaction</span>, the <span class="code">cycleTransaction()</span> overload that
    reassembles a cycle transaction was changed from <span class="code">private</span> to
    <span class="code">public</span>. Previously, this method was used only by this class for reassembling cycle
    transactions from byte buffers. It was exposed to allow the <span class="code">CycleTransactionManager</span>, in
    the change described above, to create a copy of the transaction without cycle signatures.

<p>
    In <span class="code">CycleTransactionListCommand</span>, the transaction signatures are now registered separately
    from the transaction. This is necessary because, as the comment explains, the
    <span class="code">registerTransaction()</span> method does not register signatures attached to a transaction that
    is already known to the system. While the behavior of the <span class="code">registerTransaction()</span> method is
    reasonable for operation of a verifier, it is not the desired behavior for the client, which will likely want to see
    signatures that have been received by a verifier since the last time the transaction was queried.

<p>
    The <span class="code">Hr</span> class has been modified to omit the closing tag. This class is only used,
    currently, by the documentation server.
