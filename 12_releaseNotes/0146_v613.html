<h1>Nyzo 613: client tracking</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 613
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/9bc8831736f3aa2c56f3158d689be17d70b1438b"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) improves client tracking of the blockchain and adds a client command to
    display client health metrics.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the client only.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">Client</span> class, the initialization process has been modified slightly. Previously,
    command strings for all commands were checked, and warnings were shown for any ambiguous command strings. Now, the
    errors are still shown, but the client is not allowed to start if any ambiguity is present.

<p>
    In <span class="code">ClientDataManager</span>, accumulators have been added for block fetch counts. The constant
    <span class="code">blockUpdateInterval</span> has been removed in favor of a dynamic update interval, calculated
    locally before use.
</p>

<p>
    A dynamic block update interval is now calculated. The timing is explained in the comment.

<p>
    Accessors are provided for the fetch metrics.

<p>
    In <span class="code">ClientDataManager.requestBlockWithVotes()</span>, the fetch metrics are incremented and reset
    appropriately according to the block responses.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">ClientNodeManager</span>, a method was added to provide the number of nodes in the mesh. This
    is displayed by the new client-health command.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">CommandManager</span>, the <span class="code">ClientHealthCommand</span> was added to the list
    of available commands, and the <span class="code">checkCommandStrings()</span> method was redesigned into
    <span class="code">ambiguousCommandStrings()</span>, which returns a <span class="code">Set</span> of all ambiguous
    commands.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">ClientHealthCommand</span> was assigned the short command of <span class="code">HTH</span>
    and long command of <span class="code">health</span>. This command requires no arguments, validation, or
    confirmation.
</p>

<p>
    The client-health command displays:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>number of nodes in mesh</li>
    <li>number of successful block fetches</li>
    <li>number of <span class="italic">consecutive</span> successful block fetches</li>
    <li>number of unsuccessful block fetches</li>
    <li>number of <span class="italic">consecutive</span>  unsuccessful block fetches</li>
    <li>frozen edge verification age in milliseconds</li>
</ul>
