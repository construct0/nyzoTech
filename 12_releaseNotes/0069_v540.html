<h1>Nyzo 540: sentinel monitoring&thinsp;/&thinsp;performance</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 540
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/e6d5f7334bab2d4983827cfe79bd3d97c8ed2e93"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) improves sentinel monitoring and performance.
</p>


<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the sentinel primarily. It also includes a logging option that can be activated for all run
    modes.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Sentinel</span>, a timestamp and constant have been added to ensure a minimum interval between
    blocks transmitted by this sentinel. This is a general safeguard to prevent a number of current or future situations
    where the sentinel might get into a state that would cause it to transmit a block on every iteration of its task
    loop. This type of safeguard &mdash; sensible, easy to understand, and protective against a variety of situations
    &mdash; can go a long way to promoting stability and graceful handling of exceptional circumstances in a system.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">boolean</span> variable <span class="code">blockTransmittedForManagedVerifier</span> has been
    replaced with <span class="code">lastBlockTransmissionHeight</span>. The new variable entirely replaces the function
    of the old variable &mdash; determining whether a block has been transmitted for the height currently being
    processed &mdash; and it also provides feedback to the user about when the sentinel last sent a block to try to
    protect a verifier.
</p>

<p>
    This variable is persisted using the <span class="code">PersistentData</span> class to provide proper feedback to
    the user through sentinel restarts.
</p>

<p>
    In the condition controlling entry into the section of code where blocks are created, consideration of
    <span class="code">calculatingValidChainScores</span> has been added. When a sentinel is working to build enough of
    a history to properly score blocks, new blocks will be created at every height. This results in additional work for
    the sentinel for this period, but it allows the operator of the sentinel to know as soon as the sentinel is capable
    of protecting its managed verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    Before, the <span class="code">blockTransmittedForManagedVerifier</span> flag had to be reset when blocks were
    cleared at a new height. The replacement, <span class="code">lastBlockTransmissionHeight</span>, does not require
    an analogous reset.
</p>

<img src="images/0540/rn_540_3.png" alt="RN_540 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 470px;">

<p>
    The inner condition now checks the <span class="code">lastBlockTransmissionHeight</span> against
    <span class="code">heightToProcess</span> to determine whether continuation is justified.
</p>

<p>
    The logic for determining which block to transmit has changed from requiring a non-null block to requiring a valid
    chain score. Before, transmissions would occur frequently when invalid scores were calculated. This would expose a
    sentinel to potential attacks while providing no real benefit to the managed verifiers. Now, the sentinel does not
    transmit any blocks until it can calculate valid chain scores.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">minimumBlockTransmissionInterval</span> is now enforced, and the
    <span class="code">lastBlockTransmissionTimestamp</span> is now stored to allow this enforcement. The
    <span class="code">lastBlockTransmissionHeight</span> is stored and persisted, and a yellow background has been
    added to the print statement.
</p>

<p>
    The sentinel transaction is now omitted unless the sentinel is certain that it is a valid transaction that will not
    cause the block to be rejected by the cycle.
</p>

<img src="images/0540/rn_540_7.png" alt="RN_540 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 560px;">

<p>
    Accessor methods expose the values of <span class="code">calculatingValidChainScores</span> and
    <span class="code">lastBlockTransmissionHeight</span> for use in the web interface.
</p>

<img src="images/0540/rn_540_8.png" alt="RN_540 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 310px;">

<p>
    A preference has been added to <span class="code">LogUtil</span> to add timestamps to all logging statements made
    with the <span class="code">LogUtil</span> class. This will not yet add timestamps to most logging statements, as
    use of <span class="code">System.out.println()</span> is currently much more common than
    <span class="code">LogUtil.println()</span> in the Nyzo codebase.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">SentinelController</span>, the version has been moved to the div that automatically refreshes.
    This causes the new version to display automatically if a sentinel page is open during an upgrade.
</p>

<img src="images/0540/rn_540_10.png" alt="RN_540 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 530px;">

<p>
    On this upgrade, this may cause an odd display of two versions at the same time. If this happens, refresh the page.
    This will not happen in future updates.
</p>

<p>
    The frozen-edge height is now obtained from the frozen-edge block instead of through a separate call to the
    <span class="code">BlockManager</span> class. This does not change the output or efficiency of the code. It is
    simply a better choice. The frozen-edge block is already referenced several other times in this area of code, so
    bringing in a different reference for the frozen edge adds unnecessary (though small) conceptual complexity to the
    code.
</p>

<img src="images/0540/rn_540_12.png" alt="RN_540 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 420px;">

<p>
    The cycle length, last transmission height, and protection status are now displayed. The meaning of the protection
    status is explained in the comments.
</p>

<p>
    The table in the web UI has been restructured slightly, and styles changed slightly, to improve display in Internet
    Explorer. Specifically, Internet Explorer did not understand the color <span class="code">#0005</span>, and it
    collapsed the rows of the table onto one another due to use of the <span class="code">table-caption</span> display
    property in <span class="code">verifier-tile-container</span>.
