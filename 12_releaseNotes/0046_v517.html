<h1>Nyzo 517: balance list performance</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 517
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/c1d1c77f90e18916f8fe4551d86727a121604dbe"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) reduces the workload for servicing requests for balance lists. It also
    adds a new request and response for providing the balance list of the verifier's current frozen edge. This request
    and response will take the place of the initial balance list of block requests, and future versions of the verifier
    will no longer provide initial balance lists for such requests.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version primarily affects the verifier. Some of the affected code paths are used by the sentinel, but the
    changes are insignificant to the operation of the sentinel.
</p>

<p>
    To conserve memory, few balance lists are stored in <span class="code">BalanceListManager</span> at any one time.
    While the <span class="code">BalanceListManager</span> is able to calculate the balance list for any height between
    the retention edge and frozen edge on demand, such calculations can be computationally intensive. This version
    makes some small changes to provide immediate reductions in the computational load of verifiers. It also provides a
    new message that will be the basis of future, more substantial improvements in the handling of balance lists.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BalanceListItem</span>, an override of <span class="code">toString()</span> was added. This
    was added while testing the new <span class="code">BalanceListResponse</span> message.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BalanceListManager</span>, the <span class="code">TODO</span> for removing the fields for
    Genesis, retention-edge, and frozen-edge balance lists has been eliminated. While these fields were initially added
    for testing only, they are now planned to take the place of <span class="code">balanceListMap</span> in this class.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">frozenEdgeList</span> field is now updated immediately when a new frozen-edge balance list
    is available, and an accessor for this field has been added.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">MeshListener</span>, block responses are now provided with the requester's IP address. This
    allows the responses to limit how frequently a balance list is provided for each requesting IP. Also, the
    frozen-edge balance list response has been added.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">Message</span> class, <span class="code">processContent()</span> has been changed from
    an <span class="code">if/else</span> structure to a <span class="code">switch</span> statement. Typically, the
    Nyzo codebase avoids any premature <span class="code">return</span> statements in methods (uses of a
    <span class="code">return</span> before the last line of the method), as they can cause readability issues. Also,
    <span class="code">switch</span> statements are avoided, as the Nyzo code also avoids
    <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span> uncommonly used language features, regardless of how old or
    well-understood such features may be. In general, the Nyzo code strives to use as few features as possible, as
    often as possible, in an attempt to produce a codebase that is as readable and as predictable as it can be. However,
    in this particular case, a <span class="code">switch</span> statement and early <span class="code">return</span>
    statements suit the job that needs to be done far better than the previous <span class="code">if/else</span>
    structure.

<p>
    In the <span class="code">MessageType</span> enum, types for the frozen-edge balance list request and response have
    been added.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">NicknameManager.get()</span>, a check for a null identifier has been added. This is not
    directly related to the changes in this version, but it was an issue that arose during testing.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">BalanceListResponse</span> class wraps a <span class="code">BalanceList</span> object and
    implements the <span class="code">MessageObject</span> interface. Balance-list responses are provided to each IP no
    more than once every 10 minutes.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">BlockRequest</span> class now also limits balance lists to no more than once every 10
    minutes per requesting IP. In a later version, the option to retrieve initial balance lists with block requests will
    be eliminated entirely, which will move the computational burden of deriving the balance list at a desired height
    from the responding node to the requesting node.
