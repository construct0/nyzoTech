<h1>Nyzo 588: block manager initialization</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 588
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/e00a243b1e7ee915717f8ac670db7ac901ab61c1"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) removes the Micropay run modes. It also updates the initialization process
    of <span class="code">BlockManager</span>.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the verifier, sentinel, and client. It also removes two run modes.
</p>

<p>
    This is not a critical update. It contains one optimized method that reduces memory usage, especially if the
    block-file consolidator is in use. However, its overall importance is more in preparation for future improvements in
    the block manager. Updating to this version is unnecessary if you do not find it interesting.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlacklistManager</span>, the check of whether <span class="code">BlockManager</span> has
    completed initialization has been renamed. Previously, there was a single field in
    <span class="code">BlockManager</span> that was used both as a guard for entering the initialization process and a
    flag to indicate that initialization had completed. That field has been split into two separate fields for those two
    purposes.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager</span>, the <span class="code">initialized</span> field was replaced with two
    separate fields: <span class="code">startedInitialization</span> and
    <span class="code">completedInitialization</span>. This was done to allow method synchronization to be removed
    from the <span class="code">initialize()</span> method.
</p>

<p>
    Also, the <span class="code">static</span> block has been removed. <span class="emphasis">This is a significant,
    far-reaching change.</span> This change has been fully tested for the verifier, sentinel, and client, but it may
    still have some unintended effects on scripts. This will continue to be reviewed.
</p>

<img src="images/0588/rn_588_1.png" alt="RN_588 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 320px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">isInitialized()</span> method has been renamed to
    <span class="code">completedInitialization()</span> for consistency with the new field name.
</p>

<img src="images/0588/rn_588_2.png" alt="RN_588 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 350px; max-height: 160px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">writeBlocksToFile()</span> method has been rewritten to reduce peak memory usage. Instead of
    assembling the file in memory and writing it in a single pass, a <span class="code">RandomAccessFile</span> is used
    to write individual blocks and balance lists as they are serialized. The method still sorts blocks ascending on
    height, and it still makes a map of provided balance lists for lookup.
</p>

<img src="images/0588/rn_588_3.png" alt="RN_588 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 390px;">

<p>
    The number of blocks is still written as a <span class="code">short</span> (16-bit integer), followed by the blocks.
    Each block that requires a balance list is followed by the appropriate balance list.
</p>

<img src="images/0588/rn_588_4.png" alt="RN_588 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 390px; max-height: 400px;">

<p>
    The file is written to a temporary location. After the file is written successfully, it is moved to the expected
    location, replacing the existing file. This atomic replacement ensures that invalid block files will never be
    present at their expected locations.
</p>

<p>
    A minor appearance improvement, <span class="code">Arrays.asList()</span> calls were replaced with
    <span class="code">Collections.singletonList()</span> calls in <span class="code">BlockManager.freezeBlock()</span>.
    The <span class="code">completedInitialization</span> field is now set instead of the
    <span class="code">initialized</span> field when the Genesis block is frozen. This case only happens
</p>

<img src="images/0588/rn_588_6.png" alt="RN_588 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 250px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">BlockManager.initialize()</span> method is no longer synchronized. This method was already
    mostly thread-safe, and the use of a separate <span class="code">AtomicBoolean</span> field to control entry into
    the critical section made the method fully thread-safe without method synchronization.
</p>

<p>
    Initialization time is now displayed. The initialization of <span class="code">BlockManager</span> is a significant
    part of the overall initialization of the 3 run modes that track the blockchain, and it is an important target for
    future optimization.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManagerMap</span>, a <span class="code">ConcurrentHashMap</span> is now used to allow
    synchronization to be removed from the <span class="code">addBlock()</span> method.
</p>

<img src="images/0588/rn_588_8.png" alt="RN_588 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 250px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockVoteManager</span>, the number of blocks for which votes are retained has been turned
    into a constant. Other inconsequential cleanup was also performed.
</p>

<img src="images/0588/rn_588_9.png" alt="RN_588 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 330px;">

<p>
    Consideration of the <span class="code">MicropayServer</span> run mode was removed from the <span>Message</span>
    class. The Micropay server and Micropay client were eliminated so that Micropay efforts can be focused on
    development of the client and the browser extensions.
</p>

<img src="images/0588/rn_588_10.png" alt="RN_588 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 250px; max-height: 110px;">

<p>
    Synchronization was removed from <span class="code">NewVerifierQueueManager.updateVote()</span> method. It was
    already thread-safe.
</p>

<img src="images/0588/rn_588_11.png" alt="RN_588 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 380px; max-height: 150px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">MicropayClient</span> and <span class="code">MicropayServer</span> run modes were deleted.
</p>

<img src="images/0588/rn_588_12.png" alt="RN_588 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 230px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">BlockManager.initialize()</span> method is now called immediately after setting the run mode
    for the 3 run modes that use the <span class="code">BlockManager</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0588/rn_588_13.png" alt="RN_588 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 230px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">Client</span> also initializes the <span class="code">BlockManager</span> explicitly.
</p>

<img src="images/0588/rn_588_14.png" alt="RN_588 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 360px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">MicropayAuthorization</span> class was removed. A class with similar functionality will be
    needed for the demonstration of the new browser-extension Micropay functionality, but this will be implemented as a
    clean, purpose-built solution.
</p>

<img src="images/0588/rn_588_15.png" alt="RN_588 code 15" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 260px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">MicropayClient</span> class was removed. This class was the entry point for the Micropay
    client application, which ran locally to allow in-browser payments to be made. While this was an exceptionally
    interesting application, it was never widely used.
</p>

<img src="images/0588/rn_588_16.png" alt="RN_588 code 16" class="code-image" style="width: 250px; max-height: 140px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">MicropayController</span> class, which supported the
    <span class="code">MicropayServer</span>, was also removed. The old Micropay server tracked the blockchain, serving
    as a bridge between the web and the Nyzo mesh. New Micropay functionality will not have any direct communication
    with the Nyzo mesh. Instead, all Micropay functionality will use a Nyzo client as an intermediary to the Nyzo mesh.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">MicropayEndpoint</span> class was also removed. This class managed Micropay authorizations
    and delivered web content.
</p>

<img src="images/0588/rn_588_18.png" alt="RN_588 code 18" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 380px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">MicropayServer</span> class, the entry point to the Micropay server application, was removed.
</p>

<img src="images/0588/rn_588_19.png" alt="RN_588 code 19" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 390px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">TransactionTracker</span> followed the blockchain to monitor incorporation of Micropay
    transactions.
</p>

<img src="images/0588/rn_588_20.png" alt="RN_588 code 20" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 380px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">Sentinel</span> class must now explicitly initialize <span class="code">BlockManager</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0588/rn_588_21.png" alt="RN_588 code 21" class="code-image" style="width: 290px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">WebListener</span>, consideration of the Micropay run modes has been removed.
</p>
