<h1>Nyzo 510: UDP voting added</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 510
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/06dfb488305c2888d601789d25f5288aba63ef70"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds UDP messaging for block votes. This messaging, however, is not yet
    active by default.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects only the verifier. The sentinel does not accept incoming connections, and it does not send
    block votes.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    Please read and understand the release notes before updating, as this version requires some manual steps not
    required of most updates.
</p>

<div style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 0.3em; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em; padding-bottom: 0.5em;">

    <p style="font-style: italic;">
        If you are too rushed to read the full release notes right now, these are the two additional manual steps required
        for this update. First, open port 9446 to UDP only (port 9444 should remain open to TCP only). Second,
        run this command on your verifier <span style="font-weight: bold;">after you have updated</span> to flush firewall
        rules:
    </p>

    <p class="command">
        sudo iptables -F
    </p>

</div>

<p>
    Nyzo previously used TCP for all messages. A new connection is established for each message. This results in
    significant computational, networking, and memory overhead. To improve verifier performance and stability, this
    version adds the option of using UDP for sending of block votes. While other message types may be tested with UDP
    in the future, block votes comprise the vast majority of messages in Nyzo. Sending just this one message over UDP
    minimizes the complexity of changes while providing a significant reduction in network traffic and the local
    computing resources required to support that traffic.
</p>

<p>
    To allow more time for performance testing, this version does not activate UDP messaging by default. Individual
    verifiers may choose to activate UDP, but those verifiers should be watched closely to ensure adequate performance
    scores.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="filename">README</span> file has been changed with instructions for opening port 9446 to incoming
    UDP traffic. <span class="emphasis">This is an important step. If you activate UDP and do not open the UDP port,
    your verifier will lose all block votes sent by UDP-capable verifiers.</span>
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">BlacklistManager</span> class, use of <span class="code">iptables</span> has been
    eliminated completely.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_1.png" alt="RN_510 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    This removal includes removal of the command to flush firewall rules, so some rules may be
    left from previous blacklisting by the verifier. If you are unfamiliar with <span class="code">iptables</span>, run
    this command once after updating your verifier to this version to ensure that old rules are eliminated:
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo iptables -F
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">Message.fetch()</span> method has been changed to accept a <span class="code">Node</span>
    object as an IP/port source. This is more concise, and it also allows the message class to dynamically choose
    between TCP and UDP based on the properties of the <span class="code">Node</span> object and the type of message.
    In all places where <span class="code">Message.fetch()</span> is used an an appropriate
    <span class="code">Node</span> object is available, this method is now used. If an appropriate node object is not
    available, then the <span class="code">Message.fetchTcp()</span> method, which is functionally equivalent to the
    old <span class="code">Message.fetch()</span> method, is used instead.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">FieldByteSize</span> class, an overload of the <span class="code">string()</span> method
    has been added to allow a maximum string byte length to be specified. This is used by
    <span class="code">NodeJoinMessageV2</span> and <span class="code">NodeJoinResponseV2</span> to enforce a limit
    on nickname length.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_3.png" alt="RN_510 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 508px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">MeshListener</span> class has been modified to listen to UDP traffic in addition to TCP. The
    static <span class="code">alive</span> field has been split into <span class="code">aliveTcp</span> and
    <span class="code">aliveUdp</span>. A fixed-size buffer has been added for receiving UDP packets.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_4.png" alt="RN_510 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 555px;">

<p>
    The TCP socket is functionally unchanged, and the UDP listener is a tight loop that reads packets from a
    <span class="code">DatagramSocket</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_5.png" alt="RN_510 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 535px;">

<p>
    UDP messages are read from the incoming packet using the same <span class="code">Message.fromBytes()</span> method
    that is used for incoming TCP messages. Unlike the TCP listener, which responds to all valid messages, the UDP
    listener does not yet send responses to any incoming messages.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_6.png" alt="RN_510 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 498px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">response()</span> method of <span class="code">MeshListener</span>, a response to the new
    node-join message has been added.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_7.png" alt="RN_510 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    A <span class="code">DatagramSocket</span> has been added to the <span class="code">Message</span> class. This is
    used for outgoing UDP messages.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_8.png" alt="RN_510 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 270px;">

<p>
    This modified <span class="code">fetch()</span> method now determines whether to use TCP or UDP based on the
    message type and whether the <span class="code">Node</span> accepts UDP.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_9.png" alt="RN_510 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 528px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">Message.fetch()</span> method that accepts an IP and TCP port has been renamed to
    <span class="code">fetchTcp()</span> to avoid confusion, and the <span class="code">Message.sendUdp()</span> method
    has been added. The <span class="code">sendUdp()</span> method uses the same blacklist-avoidance logic as its TCP
    counterpart, and it does not currently look for any response to messages.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_10.png" alt="RN_510 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 551px;">

<p>
    A <span class="code">discardMessageLength</span> parameter has been added to
    <span class="code">Message.fromBytes()</span> to allow for the difference in how the TCP and UDP byte arrays
    for incoming messages are obtained.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_11.png" alt="RN_510 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 488px;">

<p>
    Deserialization of <span class="code">NodeJoinMessageV2</span> and <span class="code">NodeJoinResponseV2</span> has
    been added to the <span class="code">Message.processContent()</span> method.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_12.png" alt="RN_510 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 341px;">

<p>
    Overloads of <span class="code">Message.putString()</span> and <span class="code">Message.getString()</span> have
    been added to allow specification of the maximum byte length of the string in the message. These methods are used
    for the nickname fields of the new node-join message and response.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_13.png" alt="RN_510 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 454px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">port</span> field of <span class="code">Node</span> has been renamed to
    <span class="code">portTcp</span>, and the <span class="code">portUdp</span> field has been added.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_14.png" alt="RN_510 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 499px;">

<p>
    To maintain compatibility of messages containing serialized <span class="code">Node</span> objects, the UDP port
    is not serialized. Also, this port is unnecessary in those messages, as initial communication between two verifiers
    will always happen over TCP, at which time UDP port information can be exchanged.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_15.png" alt="RN_510 code 15" class="code-image" style="width: 322px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">NodeManager.updateNode()</span> method is now aware of UDP-capable nodes.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_16.png" alt="RN_510 code 16" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    While the TCP port is updated with each node update, the UDP port is only updated when the new UDP port is valid.
    This prevents v1 node-join messages and responses from deactivating UDP for a verifier, but it also means that
    once UDP is activated for a node, it cannot be disabled without changing the IP of that node.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_17.png" alt="RN_510 code 17" class="code-image" style="width: 282px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">NodeManager.sendNodeJoinRequests()</span> method now contains code for sending both the v1
    and v2 node-join requests. The v2 code is currently commented out. This code does work, however, and all of the
    other pieces of the UDP mechanism are active in this version. So if you activate this code, your verifier will begin
    to receive over UDP instead of TCP all block-vote messages from verifiers running version 510 or later.
</p>

<p>
    The v1 node-join message will be removed completely in a later version. It is currently still necessary for
    maintaining connections to verifiers running 509 or earlier.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_18.png" alt="RN_510 code 18" class="code-image" style="width: 560px;">

<p>
    The node-join messages sent to trusted entry points are still using the v1 message. When enough of the cycle has
    updated to version 510 or later, this will be changed to the v2 message.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_19.png" alt="RN_510 code 19" class="code-image" style="width: 483px;">

<p>
    The file for verifier performance scores has been updated to another new filename. This will cause scores of all
    verifiers to reset to zero. This will allow a few days of leeway in which no verifiers should be removed for their
    performance scores. When version 511 is released, the performance scores will be reset again to ensure that all
    verifiers in the cycle start at a common point with the updated scoring system.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_20.png" alt="RN_510 code 20" class="code-image" style="width: 479px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">PortMessage</span> interface has been removed from
    <span class="code">BootstrapRequest</span>, and the port can no longer be specified in the public constructor.
    In previous versions, the port was included in this message, and it was used to update the port with the
    <span class="code">NodeManager</span>. With the advent of the sentinel, <span class="code">NodeManager</span>
    updates were restricted to node-join and node-join-response messages only. Elimination of the
    <span class="code">PortMessage</span> interface from this class makes the code easier to understand. While the
    port is no longer used, it is still serialized and deserialized to maintain message compatibility and signature
    integrity.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_21.png" alt="RN_510 code 21" class="code-image" style="width: 422px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">PortMessage</span> interface has also been removed from the
    <span class="code">NewBlockMessage</span> class.
</p>

<img src="images/0510/rn_510_22.png" alt="RN_510 code 22" class="code-image" style="width: 346px;">

<p>
    In a change unrelated to the addition of UDP, the <span class="code">VerifierRemovalTallyStatusResponse</span> is
    now sorted on descending vote count to improve readability of the response.
