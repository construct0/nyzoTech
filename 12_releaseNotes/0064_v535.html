<h1>Nyzo 535: fallback vote source</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 535
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/9e832d86740b4e490d9061fd2e6678ebeada705f"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds a fallback vote source for verifiers with insufficient blockchain
    history for calculating their own votes.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the verifier only.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockVoteManager</span>, a method has been added for retrieving the vote from a specified
    verifier at a specified height. This is used by the new voting logic to synchronize the local vote with the vote
    from another verifier.

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager</span>, the <span class="code">fallbackVoteSourceIdentifier</span> field
    has been added.
</p>

<p>
    To provide an example, if you put the following line in
    <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/preferences</span>, your verifier will vote with
    <span class="code">Nyzo 0</span> when it does not yet have enough blocks to calculate a vote of its own (don't rely
    on <span class="code">Nyzo 0</span>, though, as it will be deactivated soon):
</p>

<p class="command">
    fallback_vote_source_identifier=b5fd3e8d789a5055-091e46db881f1b74-1b0ab6f8d65b21ae-88cc543dfd92173b
</p>

<p>
    The vote description, which is displayed in the status response, has been updated to show the vote hash when an
    override is set.

<p>
    Finally, the actual fallback logic has been implemented in the <span class="code">updateVote()</span> method. The
    fallback is only used if the retention edge is less than 0, which means that the verifier does not currently have
    enough knowledge of the blockchain to calculate its own vote.
