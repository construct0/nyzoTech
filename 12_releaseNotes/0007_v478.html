<h1>Nyzo 478: sentinel</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 478
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/6e15535d4d8988c70f1c8c0b83c2cbc7cd597c25"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) introduces the Nyzo sentinel.
</p>

<p>
    Instructions for setting up the sentinel are included <a href="#rn-478-instructions">at the end of these notes</a>.
    We do recommend reading the entirety of the notes, however, as they provide important insight into how the sentinel
    works.
</p>

<p>
    This commit contains one minor change to the verifier logic, but you do not need to update your verifiers to
    use the sentinel. <span class="emphasis">The sentinel can be used to manage any
    version of the Nyzo verifier.</span>
</p>

<p>
    The one verifier change removes the penalty for inactive verifiers, which will be replaced with a comprehensive
    verifier performance metric in an upcoming release. The previous penalty code has been commented out, and it will
    be removed when the new performance metric and penalty are added.
</p>

<p>
    While the sentinel is included in the verifier codebase, it is a separate program. The sentinel should not be run
    on an instance that is running the verifier. It should be run on a dedicated
    instance. <span class="emphasis">Running the sentinel on an instance that is running the verifier is
    untested and will likely prevent the verifier and/or sentinel from functioning properly.</span>
</p>

<h2>Purpose of the sentinel</h2>

<p>
    Verifiers functioning alone are vulnerable to removal from the cycle due to temporary hardware and network issues.
    If an in-cycle verifier does not produce its block at the expected time, the verifier is skipped after and the next
    verifier's block is incorporated into the blockchain. If this happens, the skipped verifier must wait to join the
    cycle again as a new verifier. At the time of the release of this version, the expected average wait time for new
    verifiers is already several months. <span class="emphasis">The purpose of the sentinel is to
    provide improve stability of the cycle by producing blocks for in-cycle verifiers that are unable to produce
    blocks due to temporary issues.</span>
</p>

<h2>Program design</h2>

<p>
    The sentinel is a simple loop that relies on absolute trust of one or more verifiers to track the blockchain. These
    verifiers need not all be in-cycle verifiers. This is important, as many users who wish to use the sentinel may have
    only one in-cycle verifier, and the sentinel will not function properly if at least one of the verifiers it
    manages is not functioning properly. So, if you have only one in-cycle verifier, you should start a second verifier
    for the sentinel to manage.
</p>

<p>
    The sentinel first loads the managed verifiers.
</p>

<img src="images/0478/rn_478_1.png" alt="RN_478 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 527px;">

<p>
    The managed verifiers are stored in a text file with the following fields:
<ul>
    <li>IP address or host name</li>
    <li>port</li>
    <li>verifier private seed</li>
    <li>sentinel transaction flag (<span class="emphasis">optional</span>)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
    The file is read, <span class="code">ManagedVerifier</span> objects are created, and the objects are stored in
    both a list for iteration by index and in a map for lookup by identifier.
</p>

<img src="images/0478/rn_478_2.png" alt="RN_478 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 456px;">

<p>
    The verifiers are specified one per line, and the fields are separated by colons. A typical file might look like
    this.
</p>

<img src="images/0478/rn_478_3.png" alt="RN_478 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 486px;">

<p>
    The next step is fetching a bootstrap response to determine the current state of the blockchain.
</p>

<img src="images/0478/rn_478_4.png" alt="RN_478 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 492px;">

<p>
    The bootstrap response is fetched from one of the managed verifiers. The sentinel keeps querying the managed
    verifiers in a circular queue until a bootstrap response is obtained.
</p>

<p>
    Again, unlike the verifier, the sentinel <span class="emphasis">fully trusts the verifiers </span> it is managing.
    Even in the verifier initialization process, where the verifiers in the
    <span class="filename">trusted_entry_points</span> file are queried to determine the state of the blockchain, a
    democratic process is used to eliminate the need to trust any one of the entry points fully. In the following
    method, you can see that the bootstrap response is obtained from one and only one verifier, and the sentinel trusts
    that response to be honest and correct.
</p>

<img src="images/0478/rn_478_5.png" alt="RN_478 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 510px;">

<p>
    The next step you see in the <span class="code">while</span> loop above is processing of the bootstrap response.
    In order to properly score blocks, which is necessary for determining when to transmit blocks, we need about four
    cycles of the blockchain. So that the verifier can start producing blocks quickly, instead of waiting for four
    cycles of blocks to be produced, we start at a height four cycles back from the frozen edge. Before fetching a
    block at this height, though, we check to see if we already have the block or a higher block frozen locally. If a
    higher block is already frozen locally, we know that the full chain section back to the cutoff height is also
    available, as this same initialization process is completed every time the sentinel starts.
</p>

<img src="images/0478/rn_478_6.png" alt="RN_478 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 510px;">

<p>
    If a block needs to be fetched, the method attempts to fetch that block until it is obtained or each managed
    verifier is queried once. If it is not obtained, this method returns a false value, which causes the
    <span class="code">while</span> loop to iterate again and fetch a new bootstrap response. The method does not
    attempt to keep fetching the same block endlessly, as there is a small chance that the block has fallen behind the
    retention edge.
</p>

<img src="images/0478/rn_478_7.png" alt="RN_478 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 510px;">

<p>
    After the bootstrap response is processed, the sentinel enters the main application loop. The loop consists of
    three tasks:
<ul>
    <li>mesh update from managed verifiers, approximately every 20 seconds</li>
    <li>block update from managed verifiers, approximately every 2 seconds when tracking the frozen edge and every
        second when catching up to the frozen edge</li>
    <li>creation and transmission of blocks, if necessary</li>
</ul>
</p>

<img src="images/0478/rn_478_8.png" alt="RN_478 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 546px;">

<p>
    The mesh is fetched from one verifier at a time in a circular order. The mesh from each verifier is stored in a
    map so that the mesh from each verifier replaces the mesh fetched from the same verifier the last time it was
    queried.
</p>

<img src="images/0478/rn_478_9.png" alt="RN_478 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 515px;">

<p>
    The blocks are also fetched from one verifier at a time in a circular order. When in &ldquo;fast-fetch&rdquo;
    (catch-up) mode, ten blocks are fetched at a time. When tracking the frozen edge, a single block is fetched with
    each request.
</p>

<img src="images/0478/rn_478_10.png" alt="RN_478 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 547px;">

<p>
    When blocks are obtained, they are immediately frozen. This is another example of the complete trust that the
    sentinel places in the verifiers it manages.
</p>

<p>
    Multiple consecutive successful block fetches, combined with a minimum distance between the local frozen edge and
    the open edge, activate fast-fetch mode. Multiple consecutive failures deactivate fast-fetch mode.
</p>

<img src="images/0478/rn_478_11.png" alt="RN_478 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    Finally, the main loop creates and transmits blocks if it calculates that one of its managed verifiers may be in
    danger of being removed from the cycle. A verifier has approximately 80 seconds in which to produce a block before
    being removed from the cycle, so the sentinel does not even create and score blocks until it has not received a
    block for at least 30 seconds. The 30-second delay allows the sentinel to transmit blocks long before managed
    verifiers would truly be in danger of removal while also avoiding block creation entirely for the vast majority of
    heights.
</p>

<p>
    If more than 30 seconds have passed since the last frozen block was received, the set of blocks is cleared if it
    is not for the height that is currently being processed, and new blocks are made if necessary.
</p>

<img src="images/0478/rn_478_12.png" alt="RN_478 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 532px;">

<p>
    Scores are calculated for the blocks, and a block is transmitted if any of the block scores have a minimum vote
    timestamp in the past. You may recall that the verifier transmits blocks in anticipation of the minimum vote
    timestamp (10 seconds before) to keep the blockchain processing as quickly as possible. The sentinel, though, is
    intended as a fallback in exceptional cases, so its behavior always leans in favor of conservative efficiency, and
    it waits longer to transmit blocks relative to the minimum vote timestamp.
</p>

<p>
    The block message is signed by the block verifier, as new-block messages will not be accepted if they are not
    signed by verifiers that are in the cycle or at the top of the vote tally.
</p>

<p>
    While the sentinel may manage many verifiers, it never needs to transmit more than one block at any height. By
    transmitting the lowest-scored block at a height, the sentinel protects not only the verifier of that block, but
    also all verifiers of lower-scored blocks, from removal from the cycle.
</p>

<h2 id="rn-478-instructions">Installation instructions</h2>

<p>
    Installation of the sentinel is similar to installation of the verifier. However, <span class="emphasis">we do not
    recommend running the sentinel and the verifier on the same instance</span>. This is not tested and will likely
    cause either the sentinel or the verifier to malfunction.
</p>

<p>
    To start a sentinel, we recommend creating a t3.micro AWS instance with the latest Ubuntu LTS version and an 8GB
    EBS volume. Open the SSH port to your IP address so you can access the instance. Then, when you have SSHed into the
    instance, run the following commands (enter each command separately):
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo apt update
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo apt install haveged -y
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk -y
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo apt install supervisor -y
</p>

<p class="command">
    git clone https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier.git
</p>

<p class="command">
    cd nyzoVerifier
</p>

<p class="command">
    ./gradlew build
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/nyzo/production
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo cp nyzoSentinel.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/
</p>

<p>
    Now, you need to create the file that tells the sentinel which verifiers to manage. This file needs to be created
    at <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/managed_verifiers</span>. Use your favorite text editor to create
    this file on the instance, or create the file on your computer and copy it to your instance using a tool like
    <span class="code">scp</span>. Each line in the file should contain the following information for one managed
    verifier, separated by colons:
<ul>
    <li>IP address or host name</li>
    <li>port</li>
    <li>verifier private seed</li>
    <li>sentinel transaction flag (<span class="emphasis">optional</span>)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
    If the sentinel transaction flag is included and the value is &ldquo;y&rdquo; or &ldquo;Y&rdquo;, a &micro;1
    transaction will be added to any block produced for that verifier. This transaction will have &ldquo;block produced
    by Nyzo sentinel&rdquo; in the sender-data field. <span style="emphasis">This transaction is entirely
    optional</span>. This option was added mostly for entertainment value; it is not intended to be a penalty or fee.
    It is optional, and the default behavior of the sentinel is omission of this transaction.
</p>

<p>
    The following shows how the <span class="filename">managed_verifiers</span> file might look:
</p>

<img src="images/0478/rn_478_3.png" alt="RN_478 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 486px;">

<p>
    After you have created this file, start the sentinel with the following command:
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo supervisorctl reload
</p>

<p>
    To ensure that your verifiers have loaded properly, run the following command:
</p>

<p class="command">
    more /var/log/nyzo-sentinel-stdout.log | grep 'ManagedVerifier'
</p>

<p>
    The output should look something like this, with one line for each verifier you specified in the
    <span class="filename">managed_verifiers</span> file:
</p>

<img src="images/0478/sentinel_instructions_0.png" alt="sentinel instructions 0" class="code-image"
     style="width: 400px;">

<p>
    To ensure that the sentinel is tracking the blockchain, run the following command:
</p>

<p class="command">
    tail /var/log/nyzo-sentinel-stdout.log -n 30 | grep 'freezing block'
</p>

<p>
    A later version of the sentinel displays &ldquo;froze block&rdquo; instead, so the command for newer versions of
    the sentinel is:
</p>

<p class="command">
    tail /var/log/nyzo-sentinel-stdout.log -n 30 | grep 'froze block'
</p>

<p>
    The output should look something like this:
</p>

<img src="images/0478/sentinel_instructions_1.png" alt="sentinel instructions 1" class="code-image"
     style="width: 300px;">

<p>
    If you run this command several times, you should see the numbers increasing. Within about 10 minutes, depending
    on the network performance of your sentinel and the verifiers it manages, the block height should be very close to
    the frozen edge height displayed on the Nyzo mesh page.
