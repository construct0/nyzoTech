<h1>Nyzo Chrome extension 2: Micropay</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo Chrome extension version 2
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/chromeExtension/commit/924c385032d78c218e9a9d5889810becf20f58c6"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds Micropay functionality to the Nyzo Chrome extension.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version is the second part of the delivery for <a href="/teamTechnologyProposals/nttp5">NTTP-5</a>. Examples
    will be added, and this version will be submitted to the
    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nyzo/hiakfpoofhkpahdhabmfknbdedlcopbg" target="_blank">Chrome web
        store</a> to allow for more widespread adoption.
</p>

<p>
    The first version of the Nyzo Chrome extension provided the ability to send tips. This version adds the ability to
    purchase premium content: Nyzo Micropay.
</p>

<p>
    If you have not yet read the release notes to <a href="v603">version 603 of the Java codebase</a>, you may want to
    review those first to better understand the role of the Nyzo client and a typical web server in the Micropay
    process.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">ByteBuffer</span> JavaScript class, an initializer was added to allow an array to be
    loaded into a buffer. Previously, this class was only used to assemble buffers. This new initializer allows buffers
    to be used for reading.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_0.png" alt="CX_2 code 0" class="code-image" style="width: 280px; max-height: 230px;">

<p>
    Read functions, analogous to the existing write (<span class="code">put-</span>) functions, were added.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_1.png" alt="CX_2 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 260px; max-height: 330px;">

<p>
    In the content script, a <span class="code">strict</span> declaration was added, as was already present in the
    popup script. The variables for the tip parameters were renamed with the <span class="code">tip-</span> prefix to
    distinguish them from the new Micropay parameters.
</p>

<p>
    The script now scans for Micropay buttons, and multiple Micropay configurations are permitted on a single page.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_2.png" alt="CX_2 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 390px; max-height: 360px;">

<p>
    In addition to client URL, receiver ID, and sender-data tag, the Micropay buttons also include a display name and an
    amount.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_3.png" alt="CX_2 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 140px;">

<p>
    The listener for messages from the popup previously only listened for parameter requests. Now, it also listens for
    transaction availability from the popup. Transactions are stored by the popup script in the local Chrome datastore.
    The content script retrieves those transactions and dispatches them to the page along with a supplemental
    transaction. The supplemental transaction is used to demonstrate ownership of the key used for the primary
    transaction.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_4.png" alt="CX_2 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 180px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">extensionUtil.js</span>, a <span class="code">const</span> for the hash of the Genesis block
    was added. Micropay transactions, for simplicity, use the Genesis block as a reference. This makes them vulnerable
    to eclipse attacks, but this is not a concern because the transaction amounts are so small.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">getTipAmountMicronyzos()</span> function was renamed to
    <span class="code">getAmountMicronyzos()</span> to reflect its wider application in this version.
</p>

<p>
    A function for validating the maximum Micropay amount was added.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_5.png" alt="CX_2 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 290px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">cleanTag()</span> function now trims the tag value to fit the sender-data field. The
    <span class="code">cleanDisplayName()</span> function removes all characters other and a-z, A-Z, 0-9, the space,
    and the underscore. This is used to sanitize the name that is displayed in the popup menu to identify Micropay
    content.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_6.png" alt="CX_2 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 170px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">submitTransaction()</span> function no longer accepts arguments for
    <span class="code">previousHashHeight</span> and <span class="code">previousBlockHash</span>. These always reference
    the Genesis block.
</p>

<p>
    A <span class="code">try</span>/<span class="code">catch</span> was added to account for invalid responses. A null
    check on the web server result was also added.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_7.png" alt="CX_2 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 330px;">

<p>
    The fallback error message was modified to reflect the more general nature of the extension. The
    <span class="code">transactionString</span> was added to the callback to allow it to be used to retrieve content.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_8.png" alt="CX_2 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 200px;">

<p>
    A function was added to create the supplemental transaction. If Micropay becomes popular, it would be easy to
    envision someone providing a tool that tracks the blockchain and provides a lookup of previously processed
    Micropay transactions. These transactions could then be used by anyone to retrieve Micropay content. To avoid this,
    a supplemental transaction is created to prove key ownership. While old Micropay transactions may be reused to
    authorize content many times, the supplemental transaction is required to be within the message replay interval.
</p>

<p>
    An <span class="code">isUndefined()</span> helper function was added to improve code readability.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_9.png" alt="CX_2 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 180px;">

<p>
    The manifest was modified with the new version number, a modified description to reflect the expanded capabilities
    of this version, and the additional dependencies required by the content script.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_10.png" alt="CX_2 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 220px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">MicropayConfiguration</span> class encapsulates the information necessary for Micropay. Two
    functions for validating tip and Micropay configurations are provided.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_11.png" alt="CX_2 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 300px; max-height: 230px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">decode()</span> function in <span class="code">nyzoString.js</span>, Nyzo transaction
    strings are now processed.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_12.png" alt="CX_2 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 190px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">h1</span> element of the options page was updated. A field and notice were added for the
    maximum Micropay amount.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_13.png" alt="CX_2 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 310px;">

<p>
    In the options script, logic was added to handle the maximum Micropay amount.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_14.png" alt="CX_2 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 390px; max-height: 350px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">validateAndStoreMaximumMicropayAmount()</span> function checks the value provided by the
    user, provides visual feedback if the value is invalid, and stores the value in local storage.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_15.png" alt="CX_2 code 15" class="code-image" style="width: 340px; max-height: 130px;">

<p>
    The popup has been restructured to fit the new Micropay fields. The receiver ID and client URL are no longer
    displayed. The Micropay sections are displayed above the tip section.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_16.png" alt="CX_2 code 16" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 400px;">

<p>
    Dividers are displayed between sections. Up to 4 Micropay elements can be displayed for a page. Tips and Micropay
    can be present together on a page.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_17.png" alt="CX_2 code 17" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 400px;">

<p>
    Each section has its own notice divs for feedback. A notice is also displayed if the page does not support any Nyzo
    functionality. A button for opening the options menu is displayed if the extension is not correctly configured.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_18.png" alt="CX_2 code 18" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 400px;">

<p>
    The popup menu now hides before configuration to hide from the user layout changes that take place during
    configuration. The fetch of the extension configuration from local storage now uses the specific keys needed to
    avoid fetching all stored Micropay transactions. Various names have been updated for improved readability with the
    current functionality of the extension.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_19.png" alt="CX_2 code 19" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 320px;">

<p>
    The page configuration is fetched, and the Micropay buttons and tip buttons are configured. Up to 4 Micropay
    elements are supported per page, and tips and Micropay can be present together. The
    <span class="code">MicropayConfiguration</span> object is stored on the button to allow easy access when the button
    is clicked.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_20.png" alt="CX_2 code 20" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 410px;">

<p>
    Dividers are displayed as necessary between sections. A notice is displayed in the case of a communication error
    with the page.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_21.png" alt="CX_2 code 21" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 250px;">

<p>
    When configuration is complete, the body of the popup is displayed. To the user, there is no apparent delay between
    clicking the popup button and the display of the popup.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_22.png" alt="CX_2 code 22" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 200px;">

<p>
    Each Micropay element is configured separately. If a Micropay transaction amount exceeds the configured maximum, the
    button indicates this, and the transaction cannot be sent. If a previous transaction for the Micropay element is
    present in local storage, a button is presented for resending that transaction to the web server to reauthorize
    without making an additional payment. Another button is presented for clearing this transaction in case it is no
    longer valid.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_23.png" alt="CX_2 code 23" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 320px;">

<p>
    A notice is also displayed to indicate Micropay content that has already been purchased. References to other
    elements are stored with the Micropay button to simplify other code. Event listeners are added to the buttons.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_24.png" alt="CX_2 code 24" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 250px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">sendTransaction()</span> function now takes a <span class="code">button</span> argument to
    provide information about which transaction to send and to allow the interface to be reconfigured with feedback
    about the transaction.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_25.png" alt="CX_2 code 25" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 370px;">

<p>
    The transaction is created and sent to the client, and feedback about the process is displayed in the notice div.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_26.png" alt="CX_2 code 26" class="code-image" style="width: 390px; max-height: 260px;">

<p>
    The old logic for sending a tip was replaced by the newer generic logic that also encompasses Micropay.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_27.png" alt="CX_2 code 27" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 450px;">

<p>
    If a transaction is successfully transmitted to the client, it is stored and a message is sent to the content script
    to inform it that a transaction is available.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_28.png" alt="CX_2 code 28" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 290px;">

<p>
    Functions were added for resending an existing transaction from storage and clearing a transaction from storage.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_29.png" alt="CX_2 code 29" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 260px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">stringforArray()</span> function, which is used to assemble client responses for display,
    now removes <span class="code">&lt;</span> and <span class="code">&gt;</span> to reduce potential display issues
    with these responses.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_30.png" alt="CX_2 code 30" class="code-image" style="width: 320px; max-height: 110px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">configurationValid()</span> function was renamed to distinguish it from Micropay
    configuration validation, and a function was added to provide a unique reference key for indexing Micropay
    configurations.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_31.png" alt="CX_2 code 31" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 190px;">

<p>
    Some sizes were reduced to produce a more compact layout, and a <span class="code">pay-container</span> CSS class
    was added.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_32.png" alt="CX_2 code 32" class="code-image" style="width: 190px; max-height: 380px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">hover-button</span> margin was also reduced, and classes were added to support the buttons
    for resending and clearing transactions.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_33.png" alt="CX_2 code 33" class="code-image" style="width: 190px; max-height: 360px;">

<p>
    A function was added to rebuild a transaction from a serialized representation.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0002/cx2_34.png" alt="CX_2 code 34" class="code-image" style="width: 290px; max-height: 220px;">
