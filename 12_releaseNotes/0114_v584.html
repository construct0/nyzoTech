<h1>Nyzo 584: cycle-signature tx forwarding</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 584
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/2318d34b740b8dc360f6fba580d8677efd6442ff"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) corrects an issue that was preventing the client from forwarding
    cycle-signature transactions.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the client only.
</p>

<p>
    This version is due to a <a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/issues/19" target="_blank">bug report by a
    community member who opened an issue on GitHub</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">TransactionForwardCommand</span> is an exceptionally useful functionality provided by the
    client. With it, a user can create a transaction with <span class="italic">zero knowledge of the current state of
    the blockchain</span> and pass to the client all responsibility for getting that transaction into the blockchain.
    The endpoint provided by this command is already used by the
    <a href="/setupInstructions/chromeBrowserExtension">Chrome extension</a> for quickly and easily sending tips.
</p>

<p>
    However, this command was not working for cycle-signature transactions. The issue was due to cycle-signature
    transactions lacking a receiver identifier.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">TransactionForwardCommand.run()</span>, the receiver identifier of the transaction was not
    checked for a <span class="code">null</span> value. This caused an exception to be thrown when the value was used to
    create a <span class="code">NyzoStringPublicIdentifier</span> for display in the result table. A null check was
    added for this value, and another null check was added to provide better typing for the hexadecimal value.
