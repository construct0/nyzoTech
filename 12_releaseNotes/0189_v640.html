<h1>Nyzo 640: NTTP data command removal</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 640
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/e519e51998378840bd8558cbefd94b8fa1765c87"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) removes the
    <span class="code-mb">Nttp<wbr>Data<wbr>Generate<wbr>Command</span>.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the client.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code-mb">Nttp<wbr>Data<wbr>Generate<wbr>Command</span> was added in <a href="v559">version 559</a>.
    The command was intended to allow specification of both NTTP number and Git hash in the sender data of a cycle
    transaction. However, the command was never used by the cycle, and future use seems unlikely. So, we are removing
    this command to declutter the client and codebase.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code-mb">Nttp<wbr>Data<wbr>Generate<wbr>Command</span> was removed from the list of commands in
    <span class="code-mb">Command<wbr>Manager</span>.
