<h1>Nyzo Chrome 8: binary sender data</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo Chrome extension version 8
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/chromeExtension/commit/f1bba0e7192a533394e6049886051edb86cb60b8"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds support for binary (non-text) sender data.
</p>

<p>
    While plain-text sender data is convenient for readability, the increased data density of binary sender data can be
    useful, especially for hashes. This version of the extension adds support for
    <a href="/dataFormats/normalizedSenderDataString">normalized sender-data strings</a> to allow use of
    binary/hex/non-text sender data. Importantly, this version does not change the data type presented to the Javascript
    interface &mdash; plain text is still used &mdash; so it is fully backward-compatible with pages written for earlier
    versions. In both directions, normalized sender-data strings pass binary data between page Javascript and the
    extension.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code-mb">content</span> script, a function call was changed from
    <span class="code-mb">string<wbr>As<wbr>Uint<wbr>8<wbr>Array()</span> to
    <span class="code-mb">sender<wbr>Data<wbr>As<wbr>Uint<wbr>8<wbr>Array()</span> due to renaming of the target
    function.

<p>
    In the <span class="code-mb">extensionUtil</span> script, the
    <span class="code-mb">maximum<wbr>Sender<wbr>Data<wbr>Length</span> constant was added to improve code readability.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code-mb">clean<wbr>Tag()</span> function was modified to allow longer strings and all characters.
    This will require extra scrutiny of sender data when it is used, as the strict filtering used previously provided
    extra protection against attacks of the extension.

<p>
    In the <span class="code-mb">popup</span> script, protections were added to ensure event listeners for some events
    were not added multiple times.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code-mb">send<wbr>Transaction()</span> function of the <span class="code-mb">popup</span>
    script, the comment was updated to reflect the fact that the function is used by both the tip and Micropay buttons.
    A function call was also changed from <span class="code-mb">string<wbr>As<wbr>Uint<wbr>8<wbr>Array()</span> to
    <span class="code-mb">sender<wbr>Data<wbr>As<wbr>Uint<wbr>8<wbr>Array()</span> due to renaming of the target
    function.
</p>

<p>
    The interesting changes of this version are in the <span class="code-mb">util</span> script. The
    <span class="code-mb">string<wbr>As<wbr>Uint<wbr>8<wbr>Array()</span> function was renamed to
    <span class="code-mb">sender<wbr>Data<wbr>As<wbr>Uint<wbr>8<wbr>Array()</span> and largely rewritten. Processing of
    normalized sender-data strings was implemented based on the Java method
    <span class="code-mb">bytes<wbr>From<wbr>Normalized<wbr>Sender<wbr>Data<wbr>String()</span> method of the
    <span class="code-mb">Client<wbr>Transaction<wbr>Util</span> class in the verifier code base. A string of the
    correct length is checked first for proper formatting.
</p>

<p>
    If the input string is a valid normalized sender-data string, the bytes of that string are extracted. Otherwise, the
    string is interpreted as plain text.
