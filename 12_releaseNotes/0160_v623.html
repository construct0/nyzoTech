<h1>Nyzo 623: search pending transactions</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 623
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/ef5917a77e4ba0df6e03fba8b7b8d13d7b2b7431"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) provides an option for the
    <span class="code">TransactionIndexedSearchCommand</span> to return pending transactions in addition to confirmed
    transactions.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the client.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">ClientArgumentUtil</span>, a method was added for processing <span class="code">boolean</span>
    client arguments. The following inputs evaluate to <span class="code">true</span> (including all case combinations,
    such as <span class="italic">Yes</span> and <span class="italic">trUE</span>):
</p>

<ul class="code">
    <li>true</li>
    <li>t</li>
    <li>yes</li>
    <li>y</li>
    <li>1</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The following inputs evaluate to false, including all case combinations:
</p>

<ul class="code">
    <li>false</li>
    <li>f</li>
    <li>no</li>
    <li>n</li>
    <li>0</li>
</ul>

<p>
    All other inputs are treated as if an input is not provided, and the method returns the default value.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">TransactionForwardCommand</span>, the <span class="code">maximumMapSize</span> constant was
    modified to allow specification in the preferences file with the key
    <span class="code">transaction_forward_command_maximum_map_size</span>. The default of
    <span class="code">1000</span> is the same as the previous value, so behavior is unchanged if this prefence is not
    used.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">TranactionForwardCommand.transactionsForAccount()</span> method follows the same pattern as
    the <span class="code">TransactionIndexer.transactionsForAccount()</span> method. It has the same arguments, and it
    applies these arguments in the same way.
</p>

<p>
    However, instead of reading transactions from indexed files, this method searches through the values of the
    <span class="code">recentlyForwardedTransactions</span> map. This method performs a full search of the map, but the
    map size can be kept to a manageable size to avoid computational concerns.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">TransactionIndexedSearchCommand</span>, the <span class="code">includePending</span>
    argument was added. The default value of this argument is <span class="code">false</span>, which is important.
    Previously, this command provided only transactions that had been confirmed by the cycle. Changing the default
    behavior of this command to include unconfirmed transactions would be misleading to any clients of the API that were
    unaware of the change.
</p>

<p>
    In the response, an <span class="code">isConfirmed</span> field was added to differentiate confirmed transactions
    from pending transactions.
</p>

<p>
    If pending transactions are requested, they are added to the result after the confirmed transactions.
