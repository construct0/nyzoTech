<h1>Nyzo 485: status responses</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 485
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/06c67c534489a39b4d9fceaebeb8af19c4874527"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) corrects an issue related to caching of status responses.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version does not significantly alter behavior of the verifier or the sentinel. It only corrects a small issue
    with the status response of the verifier.
</p>

<p>
    In version 481, the status response was changed to add some information only for self-signed requests. However,
    the <span class="code">StatusResponse</span> class used a caching mechanism that would store and reuse a
    previously generated response. If someone else were to send a status request immediately after a self-signed
    request, the other requester could improperly receive the more detailed response intended only for self-signed
    requests.
</p>

<p>
    This is not an urgent update, as the additional information disclosed was mostly previously available publicly and
    is not especially sensitive. If you are especially concerned about disclosure of the information reserved for
    self-signed requests, simply avoid making self-signed requests until you have updated to this version or later.
</p>

<p>
    Caching of status responses was an unnecessary optimization, so the fix for this problem was removal of the caching.
    The commit looks more substantial than it is due to git's handling of indentation changes. Two static variables were
    removed and an <span class="code">if/else</span> condition was eliminated. No other changes were made.
