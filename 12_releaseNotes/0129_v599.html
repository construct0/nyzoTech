<h1>Nyzo 599: verifier-removal votes</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 599
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/61b9539d0c30366c8aac80ea3edce81ad760402a"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) reduces the rate at which verifier-removal votes are sent.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects only the verifier. No other run modes send verifier-removal votes.
</p>

<p>
    This version is based on <a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/issues/21" target="_blank">a GitHub
    issue</a> concerning TCP message volume due to verifier-removal votes. While verifier-removal votes are important,
    they are not urgent. This version reduces the frequency of these vote messages from 10 per block to one per block.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">VerifierPerformanceManager</span>, the <span class="code">messagesPerIteration</span> constant
    was removed. The new process is unable to send a variable number of messages; it sends exactly one message per
    iteration.

<p>
    In <span class="code">VerifierPerformanceManager.sendVotes()</span>, the cutoff timestamp is no longer calculated.
    Instead of sending to multiple verifiers under a cutoff, the new logic sends to only one verifier with the oldest
    timestamp.

<p>
    The new process sends the verifier-removal vote to a verifier with the oldest timestamp. The timestamp represents
    the last time this running that this verifier sent a removal vote to the other verifier. Initially, all of these
    timestamps will be <span class="code">0</span>. In the steady state, this is essentially a circular queue. While
    this process takes time to distribute votes, the time required is inconsequential. The verifier-removal process
    exists to ensure that underperforming verifiers are eventually removed. This process does not, to be effective,
    require swift action.
