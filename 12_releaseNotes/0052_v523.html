<h1>Nyzo 523: Nyzo client</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 523
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/e5ff714d6fa7120783b06b989ea55116d204c9cd"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) introduces the Nyzo client.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the client, verifier, and sentinel. The changes to the verifier and the sentinel are
    inconsequential side effects of changes made in the implementation of the client.
</p>

<p>
    Please realize that this is a minimal version of the client. It does not yet allow sending of transactions. Its
    tracking of the blockchain is limited and does not yet include any attempt to establish a full history of the
    blockchain. These limitations will be addressed in future versions.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">ChainInitializationManager</span>, the <span class="code">bootstrapResponses</span> map has
    been changed to the concurrent version.
</p>

<p>
    Three of the methods used on the initialization process have been narrowed in visibility from public to private.
    Synchronization has also been removed from one of them; it is no longer necessary due to use of the concurrent
    hash map. The initialization process that was previously in the <span class="code">Verifier</span> has been
    encapsulated in the <span class="code">initializeFrozenEdge()</span> method. This was done to allow both the client
    and verifier to access this code, and it is what allowed narrowing of the visibility of the other methods.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message</span>, the <span class="code">fetchFromRandomNode()</span> method has been refactored
    to allow different behavior in the sentinel and client. This is useful because they each use their own method of
    tracking which nodes are in the mesh.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_2.png" alt="RN_523 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 446px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">MessageQueue</span>, the log statement has been changed to use the new
    <span class="code">LogUtil</span> class.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_3.png" alt="RN_523 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 283px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">RunMode</span> enumeration tracks whether the code is running as verifier, sentinel, or
    client. This is currently used only in the <span class="code">LogUtil</span> class and in the
    <span class="code">Message.fetchFromRandomNode()</span> method, but it will likely be useful in other places in
    future versions.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_4.png" alt="RN_523 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 251px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Verifier</span>, the run mode is set just before the <span class="code">start()</span>
    method is called. The <span class="code">main()</span> method of the <span class="code">Verifier</span> class is
    the default entry point of the jar file. This is why the run mode is not set at the top of the
    <span class="code">main()</span> method as it is in the sentinel and client.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_5.png" alt="RN_523 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 255px;">

<p>
    The frozen-edge initialization code that was moved to the <span class="code">ChainInitializationManager</span> class
    is now accessed through the appropriate method call.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_6.png" alt="RN_523 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 559px;">

<p>
    Visibility of the <span class="code">getTrustedEntryPoints()</span> method has been changed to allow access from
    <span class="code">ClientDataManager</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_7.png" alt="RN_523 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 340px;">

<p>
    The client is a simple interactive console application. The program loop asks for which command to run and then
    collects the necessary arguments and dispatches them to the appropriate command handler. As more functionality is
    added to the client, it will be encapsulated in separate command handlers for each task.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_8.png" alt="RN_523 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 477px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">ClientDataManager</span> tracks the mesh and blockchain for the client. Use of a democratic
    process for the Genesis block in addition to the frozen edge means that the client should be able to connect,
    without modifications, to any Nyzo-based blockchain.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_9.png" alt="RN_523 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 520px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">ClientNodeManager</span> manages mesh information for the client. The verifier, sentinel,
    and client all need different node managers because they all have different relationships with the mesh. The
    verifier is an active participant in the mesh. Neither the sentinel nor the client are participants in the mesh, so
    they must rely on verifiers for mesh information. The sentinel has a fully-trusted relationship with all the
    verifiers it queries for mesh information, but the client does not.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_10.png" alt="RN_523 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 533px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">Command</span> enumeration is a wrapper for the command handlers. Currently, only four
    commands are included, and three of those are system commands (i.e., not actual tasks). The only useful command in
    this version is <span class="code">balance</span>. In the lines commented out, you can see some of the other
    commands currently in development.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_11.png" alt="RN_523 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 512px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">ConsoleColor</span> enumeration provides simple ANSI console coloring. This is disabled by
    default, as non-ANSI consoles display erroneous characters for ANSI color commands. To enable this functionality,
    place the line <span class="code">enable_console_color=1</span> in
    <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/preferences</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_12.png" alt="RN_523 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 520px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">ConsoleUtil</span> class provides a simple mechanism for printing tables of data.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_13.png" alt="RN_523 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 405px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">BalanceDisplayCommandHandler</span> displays the balances of accounts with a specified prefix
    at the current local frozen edge. This is the only command handler of utility in this version of the client.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_14.png" alt="RN_523 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 507px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">CommandHandler</span> interface will be used for all the commands in the client. Separation
    of the argument names from execution of the handler will allow different interfaces, including a web interface, to
    share the same command handler.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_15.png" alt="RN_523 code 15" class="code-image" style="width: 212px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">EmptyCommandHandler</span> prints the available commands if no command is provided.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_16.png" alt="RN_523 code 16" class="code-image" style="width: 273px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">ExitCommandHandler</span> terminates the client.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_17.png" alt="RN_523 code 17" class="code-image" style="width: 419px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">InvalidCommandHandler</span> is similar to the <span class="code">EmptyCommandHandler</span>,
    but it also provides feedback that an invalid command was provided.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_18.png" alt="RN_523 code 18" class="code-image" style="width: 523px;">

<p>
    The sentinel, like the client, sets the run mode at the top of the <span class="code">main()</span> method.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_19.png" alt="RN_523 code 19" class="code-image" style="width: 241px;">

<p>
    The sentinel block-with-votes fallback now uses the run-mode-aware
    <span class="code">Message.fetchFromRandomNode()</span> method.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_20.png" alt="RN_523 code 20" class="code-image" style="width: 558px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">randomNode()</span> method has been changed to public visibility to allow access from the
    <span class="code">Message</span> class.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_21.png" alt="RN_523 code 21" class="code-image" style="width: 224px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">LogUtil</span> class suppresses console output for messages in the client run mode. Like some
    other classes introduced in this version, this class is little more than a placeholder for planned future
    functionality.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_22.png" alt="RN_523 code 22" class="code-image" style="width: 318px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">PreferencesUtil</span> has a new <span class="code">getBoolean()</span> method. This method is
    used by <span class="code">ConsoleColor</span> to activate the color codes.
</p>

<img src="images/0523/rn_523_23.png" alt="RN_523 code 23" class="code-image" style="width: 361px;">

<p>
    To use the client, follow the installation instructions for the verifier. Then, run the following command from the
    <span class="filename">nyzoVerifier</span> directory:
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo java -jar build/libs/nyzoVerifier-1.0.jar co.nyzo.verifier.client.Client
</p>
