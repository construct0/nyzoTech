<h1>Nyzo 587: relay server directories</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 587
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/71d64e44b65be0b7c3c3244f84a91a32504c0048"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds the ability to load entire directories on the relay server. Also, it
    eliminates in-memory caching of files to conserve memory usage.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the relay server only.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">RelayController.buildEndpointMap()</span>, the update interval is no longer read for file
    endpoints. If an update interval is provided, it is ignored.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">RelayEndpoint</span>, the <span class="code">response</span> field was renamed to
    <span class="code">cachedWebResponse</span> to reflect its new responsibility. Also
    <span class="code">lastRequestTimestamp</span> was renamed to <span class="code">lastRefreshTimestamp</span> to
    reflect a change in when it is assigned.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">isFileEndpoint</span> field was added to improve code readability and eliminate frequent
    examination of the <span class="code">sourceEndpoint</span> field to determine whether an endpoint is a web-relay
    endpoint or file endpoint.
</p>

<p>
    A new constructor that does not require an update interval was added. Both constructors now assign the
    <span class="code">isFileEndpoint</span> field. In practice, the one-argument constructor will be used for file
    endpoints, and the two-argument constructor will be used for web-relay endpoints, but both result in valid objects
    for both types of endpoints.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">RelayEndpoint.getResponse()</span>, file endpoints are now read on demand. This logic also now
    considers the possibility of an endpoint representing a directory, not just an individual file. In this case, the
    endpoint returns the contents of the appropriate file in the directory.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">RelayEndpoint.refresh()</span>, reading of files was eliminated. The timestamp is also set
    when the cached response is stored instead of being set before the request is sent. This unifies the meaning of the
    content's <span class="code">Last-Modified</span> header and the internal refresh timestamp.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">Endpoint.getParentEndpoint()</span> method was added to facilitate the new directory
    functionality.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">EndpointResponse</span>, content types were added for PDFs and binary files. The file type is
    now binary (<span class="code">contentTypeOctetStream</span>) for unrecognized file extensions.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">WebListener</span>, the parent endpoint is tested if the full endpoint is not available. This
    completes the behavior that allows for directories to be added to the <span class="code">WebListener</span>,
    updating dynamically as new files are available.
