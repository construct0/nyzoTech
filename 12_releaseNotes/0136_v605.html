<h1>Nyzo 605: linear IP lottery</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 605
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/adaf536b22a0b3448433cb69fb406811c599fdba"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) changes the lottery to use IP address, using a constrained linear distance
    between addresses to adjust probability.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the verifier only. This version fulfills delivery for
    <a href="/teamTechnologyProposals/nttp7">NTTP-7</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The new calculation converts the IP address to an integer value in the range
    <span class="code">[0 - 4294967295]</span>. The IP address <span class="code">0.0.0.0</span> corresponds to
    <span class="code">0</span> and the IP address <span class="code">255.255.255.255</span> corresponds to
    <span class="code">4294967295</span>. Some other values, for illustration, are:
</p>

<p class="pad" style="text-align: center;">
            0.0.0.0:           0
            0.0.0.1:           1
          0.0.0.255:         255
            0.0.1.0:         256
          0.0.1.255:         511
            0.0.2.0:         512
          0.0.2.255:         767
        0.0.255.255:       65535
            0.1.0.0:       65536
          0.255.0.0:    16711680
    127.255.255.255:  2147483647
          128.0.0.0:  2147483648
    255.255.255.255:  4294967295
</p>

<p>
    Or, put more simply, the IP address is interpreted as a 4-byte unsigned integer in big-endian byte order.
</p>

<p>
    Of course, large ranges of the IP address space are inaccessible to potential verifiers. This is handled
    appropriately by the lottery logic.
</p>

<p>
    The IP addresses in the lottery are depicted in the following image. The image is 1024 pixels wide, and each pixel
    represents an equally sized partition of the IPv4 space, with address <span class="code">0.0.0.0</span> on the far
    left and <span class="code">255.255.255.255</span> on the far right.
</p>

<img src="images/0605/rn_605_ip_distribution_lottery.png" alt="RN_605 IP distribution lottery"
     class="code-image" style="width: 512px; height: 50px;">

<p>
    While this image illustrates the clustering of IP addresses, it is only looking at one scale of the problem space.
    Addressing only the clustering apparent in this image would ignore some clustering at finer scales.
</p>

<p>
    The use of a linear value space for IP addresses naturally places closely spaced IP addresses at a disadvantage.
    However, it provides too much of an advantage to certain IP addresses.
    <a href="#footnote" onclick="highlightFootnote('footnote');">So, instead of calculating the distance to IP
        addresses, constrained ranges of IP addresses are hashed, and the distance in the hash space is used to
        determine the winner.</a>
</p>

<p>
    All of the changes in this version take place in <span class="code">NewVerifierQueueManager</span>. The
    <span class="code">maximumIpValueInterval</span> determines the maximum distance between two IP addresses that will
    contribute to an increased probability of selection.
</p>

<img src="images/0605/rn_605_0.png" alt="RN_605 code 0" class="code-image" style="width: 310px; max-height: 190px;">

<p>
    The old logic for selecting the winning node in the lottery was replaced with the linear-IP selection logic. The
    selection logic is encapsulated in the <span class="code">winningNodeForCycleHash()</span> method.
</p>

<img src="images/0605/rn_605_1.png" alt="RN_605 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 310px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">winningNodeForCycleHash()</span> method first calculates integer
    (<span class="code">long</span>, to avoid issues related to Java's lack of a 4-byte unsigned integer) values for all
    IP addresses in the lottery, storing the nodes in <span class="code">rawValueToNodeMap</span>, which is keyed on
    these values.
</p>

<img src="images/0605/rn_605_2.png" alt="RN_605 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 170px;">

<p>
    After building the map, the values are sorted ascending. Nodes get entries into the lottery based on their IP
    addresses and half of the IP addresses in both directions, of the linear space. The
    <span class="code">maximumIpValueInterval</span> is imposed to ensure that large gaps in the address space do not
    provide excessive lottery entries to the nodes bordering those gaps.
</p>

<img src="images/0605/rn_605_3.png" alt="RN_605 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 370px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">ipToLong()</span> method maps the IP address space to the
    <span class="code">[0 - 4294967295]</span> range.
</p>

<img src="images/0605/rn_605_4.png" alt="RN_605 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 250px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">closerHash()</span> method determines which of two hashes are closer to the reference hash.
    The hashes are treated as 32-byte big-endian integers.
</p>

<img src="images/0605/rn_605_5.png" alt="RN_605 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 370px; max-height: 35s0px;">

<p>
    This selection logic works at the finest scale, controlling probability by modifying distances between pairs of IP
    addresses. However, the effects are seen at all scales. Looking back to the graph of IP addresses, the counts within
    bins also represent relative probabilities of entry from each bin when all IP addresses are afforded equal
    probability.
</p>

<img src="images/0605/rn_605_ip_distribution_lottery.png" alt="RN_605 IP distribution lottery"
     class="code-image" style="width: 512px; height: 50px;">

<p>
    Under the new logic, the relative probability of entry from each bin can be calculated by looking at the sum of the
    space the each bin occupies in the compressed space. This results in higher entrance probabilities for many of the
    sparsely populated bins.
</p>

<img src="images/0605/rn_605_ip_probability.png" alt="RN_605 IP probability"
     class="code-image" style="width: 512px; height: 50px;">

<p>
    Simulating a winner 10,000 times with the new logic consistently shows a distribution that is in line with these
    probabilities. Each image represents a different set of 10,000 simulated lottery winners.
</p>

     class="code-image" style="width: 512px; height: 50px;">

<p>
    Remember that each bin represents 1/1024 of the entire IP address space, which is over 4 million potential addresses
    per bin. The new peak is a bin that contains 447 IP addresses with an average constrained gap of 15.7, just under
    the maximum of 16 defined by <span class="code">maximumIpValueInterval</span> in
    <span class="code">NewVerifierQueueManager</span>.
</p>

<p>
    If we zoom in and create images of the same size from single bins in the original image, each bin in the resultant
    image represents 4,096 IP addresses. For this, we will examine bins 207, 216, 383, 424, 579, and 712. These are
    marked in the following image of lottery IP distribution.

<p>
    In all of these images, we see emergence of bins with exceptionally small unmodified probabilities to represent
    substantial combined probabilities after modification. So, we see not just positive effects on diversity at the
    widest scale, we also see positive effects at a moderate scale, while the logic is implemented on the finest scale.

<div id="footnote" class="footnote">
    <p>
        Our preferred selection logic maps both the cycle hash and the IP addresses to linear decimal values in the
        <span class="code">[0.0 - 1.0]</span> range. It then collapses the linear IP address space to impose a maximum
        interval between addresses, maps the cycle hash value to the collapsed space, and finds the closest IP address
        in this space to the mapped hash value.
    </p>

    <p>
        This logic is especially desirable because it is easy to understand and visualize, and it also provides much
        more freedom in adjusting <span class="code">maximumIpValueInterval</span>. In the current logic, increasing
        <span class="code">maximumIpValueInterval</span> increases computational burden. In the preferred logic,
        the value of <span class="code">maximumIpValueInterval</span> does not affect computational burden.
    </p>

    <p>
        This current logic is a modification of the preferred concept that is less vulnerable to vote scattering due to
        information differences among verifiers. In the preferred logic, stacking of the collapsed space results in a
        single information difference affecting the positions of all subsequent verifiers in the space.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our preferred logic will be implemented when/if information regarding the out-of-cycle verifier pool is stored
        on the blockchain and fully consistent among all verifiers.
