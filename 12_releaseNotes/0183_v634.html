<h1>Nyzo 634: unconfirmed-state improvements</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 634
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/71177a9010ed26c24cc32b9613557ea052986fe8"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) improves management of unconfirmed-state processing.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code-mb">Client<wbr>Data<wbr>Manager</span>, the <span class="code-mb">previous<wbr>Frozen<wbr>
    Edge<wbr>Height</span> is stored outside the primary loop. This allows detection of frozen-edge changes, and
    processes that only need to be performed once per block are no longer called every loop iteration.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>Manager.<wbr>process<wbr>Block()</span> method is now only called once
    per block. The <span class="code-mb">Transaction<wbr>Forward<wbr>Command.<wbr>perform<wbr>Maintenance()</span>
    method is also now called once per block. This method was previously run periodically by the
    <span class="code-mb">Transaction<wbr>Forward<wbr>Command</span> when it received transactions to prevent the
    <span class="code-mb">recently<wbr>Forwarded<wbr>Transactions</span> map from growing too large. The
    <span class="code-mb">Client<wbr>Data<wbr>Manager</span> has a different motivation for running the method: to
    clear out older transactions so they do not get picked up by the <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>
    Manager</span>.

<p>
    In <span class="code-mb">Transaction<wbr>Forward<wbr>Command</span>, reset of the
    <span class="code-mb">requests<wbr>Since<wbr>Maintenance</span> counter was moved inside the
    <span class="code-mb">perform<wbr>Maintenance()</span> method so reset will always occur when maintenance is
    performed.

<p>
    In <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>Manager</span>, filtering was added to ensure that all transactions
    that no longer have an opportunity to be incorporated into a confirmed script state are removed before processing of
    the unconfirmed state.
