<h1>Nyzo 633: unconfirmed script states</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 633
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/f345d9973e6cf6d626777ac89acc9e973d2b1d2e"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds an option the <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>
    Command</span> to return script states that include information from unconfirmed (pending) transactions.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the client.
</p>

<p>
    Those who followed development of the <a href="/micropay/gameExample">tic-tac-toe Micropay game example</a> will
    recall that gameplay was rather slow in the initial implementation. Moves did not appear until the transactions
    representing them were confirmed by the cycle. <a href="v623">Version 623</a> provided an option for the
    <span class="code-mb">Transaction<wbr>Indexed<wbr>Search<wbr>Command</span> to return pending transactions in
    addition to confirmed transactions, which made gameplay almost instant.
</p>

<p>
    This version adds a similar improvement to the <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>Command</span>. An option
    to include unconfirmed transactions in script results allow users to see the effects of those transactions almost
    immediately.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code-mb">Client<wbr>Data<wbr>Manager.<wbr>start()</span>, the <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>
    Script<wbr>Manager.<wbr>start()</span> method is called.
</p>

<p>
    An argument to request inclusion of unconfirmed transactions was added to <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>
    Command</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0633/rn_633_1.png" alt="RN_633 image 1" class="code-image" style="width: 350px; max-height: 159px;">

<p>
    When running <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>Command</span>, the new argument is read and passed to
    <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>Manager.<wbr>state<wbr>For<wbr>Account()</span>. The default value of this
    argument is <span class="code-mb">false</span>, which means that behavior of this command does not change for users
    who do not provide a value.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code-mb">all<wbr>Transactions()</span> method was added to the
    <span class="code-mb">Transaction<wbr>Forward<wbr>Command</span> to provide access to the pool of pending
    transactions.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>Manager.<wbr>start()</span> method starts a thread that runs a loop
    for processing scripts with unconfirmed transactions. Currently, the loop sleeps 3 seconds each iteration. To
    improve responsiveness of script states, this sleep will likely be reduced in duration after some protections are
    implemented to ensure excessive resources are not consumed by this thread.
</p>

<p>
    In initial state creation, a <span class="code-mb">false</span> argument was added to the
    <span class="code-mb">state<wbr>For<wbr>Account()</span> method call. This results in the method call behaving as it
    did previously.
</p>

<img src="images/0633/rn_633_5.png" alt="RN_633 image 5" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>Manager.<wbr>state<wbr>For<wbr>Account()</span>, the new
    <span class="code-mb">include<wbr>Unconfirmed<wbr>Transactions</span> argument causes the method to look to the
    <span class="code-mb">unconfirmed<wbr>State<wbr>Map</span> for a state that includes information from unconfirmed
    transactions. If this argument is <span class="code-mb">false</span> or if the state is not present in the
    <span class="code-mb">unconfirmed<wbr>State<wbr>Map</span>, the state is read from file.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>Manager.<wbr>process<wbr>Unconfirmed<wbr>Transactions()</span> method
    is the unconfirmed-transaction equivalent of <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>Manager.<wbr>process<wbr>
    Block<wbr>Internal()</span>. This method retrieves transactions from the <span class="code-mb">Transaction<wbr>
    Forward<wbr>Command</span> and builds lists of transactions grouped by recipient.
</p>

<img src="images/0633/rn_633_7.png" alt="RN_633 image 7" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 230px;">

<p>
    <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>Manager.<wbr>process<wbr>Unconfirmed<wbr>Transactions()</span> then
    creates states with the unconfirmed transactions. The resulting states are stored in a map for later retrieval.
</p>

<p>
    Exceptions are logged. At the end of the method, the <span class="code-mb">new<wbr>Unconfirmed<wbr>State<wbr>
    Map</span> is swapped to replace the <span class="code-mb">unconfirmed<wbr>State<wbr>Map</span>. This is an atomic
    swap, which eliminates any potential for threading issues.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>Manager.<wbr>process<wbr>Block<wbr>Internal()</span>, a
    <span class="code-mb">false</span> argument was added to the <span class="code-mb">state<wbr>For<wbr>
    Account()</span> method call. This results in the method call behaving as it did previously.
</p>
