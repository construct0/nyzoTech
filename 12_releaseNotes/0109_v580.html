<h1>Nyzo 580: fee correction</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 580
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/6a38d4bd0375a60ca879055116257dd77147f7f5"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) corrects a mistake in the fee calculation for low-balance accounts.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects all run modes. The code change in this version will not affect behavior until blockchain
    version 3.
</p>

<p>
    As part of the quality assurance process for Nyzo, a clean-room implementation of the balance-list calculations is
    maintained. It is independently implemented based on the balance list rules. This implementation is used to derive
    balance lists from blocks as they are produced by the cycle. The resulting balance lists are compared to the balance
    lists produced by verifiers, and an alert is raised if there is any mismatch between the two.
</p>

<p>
    This system produced an alert at block 7170522.

</p>

<p>
    The "correct" values are the values provided by the balance list. The "calculated" values are from the alternate
    implementation. A single account is &micro;100 higher than it should be, and 10 other accounts are &micro;10 lower
    than they should be. The source of this discrepancy was easily found in the <span class="code">Block</span> class.
</p>

<p>
    The &micro;100 periodic fee that should have applied to all blockchain versions 1 and above was mistakenly applied
    to only blockchain version 1. This cannot be corrected for blockchain version 2, because the incorrect rule has
    already been used. The fix is being released now in the interest of transparency. Consensus rules regarding
    balance-list spam will continue to provide partial protection in this area, and reactivation of this rule in
    blockchain version 3 will quickly eliminate small accounts.
