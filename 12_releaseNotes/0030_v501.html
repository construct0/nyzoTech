<h1>Nyzo 501: blacklist connection count</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 501
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/e6d3b614d698b1273a7861bf1f177f629ba8d6e0"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) corrects blacklist logic issues in the
    <span class="code">MeshListener</span> class.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the verifier only. The sentinel does not use the <span class="code">MeshListener</span> class.
</p>

<p>
    Two separate logic errors in the <span class="code">MeshListener</span> class were causing incorrect accumulations
    of concurrent-connection counts, resulting in erroneous and recurrent blacklisting of many IP addresses. While
    some protection mechanisms are mitigating this problem, the issue is serious, and all verifiers should update as
    soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
    The first, more serious, logic error was in the handling of the <span class="code">merge()</span> call on the
    <span class="code">connectionsPerIp</span> map. This call was used to obtain <span class="code">AtomicInteger</span>
    objects, and these objects were incremented and decremented directly. However, as each
    <span class="code">merge()</span> call produced a new <span class="code">AtomicInteger</span> object, any call to
    <span class="code">merge()</span> that was followed by another call to <span class="code">merge()</span> for the
    same IP before the corresponding decrement call would result in a permanent increase in the count for that IP
    address. Therefore, instead of tracking present concurrent connections per IP, the map functioned more as a
    historical aggregator of concurrent connections per IP.
</p>

<p>
    The map is still used, but <span class="code">AtomicInteger</span>s have been replaced with
    <span class="code">Integer</span>s, as atomic increments and decrements of the individual objects have been
    replaced with the atomic <span class="code">merge</span> operation. The merge function has been rewritten to use
    <span class="code">Integer</span> objects.
</p>

<p>
    The map type arguments have been updated appropriately in the <span class="code">connectionsPerIp</span> declaration
    and <span class="code">processSocket()</span> signature.
</p>

<p>
    All increment operations have been replaced with <span class="code">merge()</span> calls with a value of
    <span class="code">1</span>, and all decrement operations have been replaced with <span class="code">merge()</span>
    calls with a value of <span class="code">-1</span>.
</p>

<p>
    The other issue, while less serious on its own, eliminated a protection that would have prevented the first issue
    from inappropriately blacklisting verifiers. The first issue caused errors to accumulate in the
    <span class="code">connectionsPerIp</span> map. The second issue prevented the
    <span class="code">connectionsPerIp</span> map from being periodically cleared. While this periodic clearing of the
    map was only intended as a memory-conservation measure, it would have also erased the accumulated errors frequently
    enough that they would likely have never produced any symptoms.
</p>

<p>
    The map was never cleared because the increment of <span class="code">activeReadThreads</span> was omitted.
    Therefore, the value of <span class="code">activeReadThreads</span> was always negative, never the value of exactly
    <span class="code">0</span> required to trigger clearing of the map.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, decrementing of the number of connections per IP has been moved just before clearing of the map instead
    of just after. If the decrement were performed just after clearing of the map, the value would incorrectly be
    <span class="code">-1</span> for the affected IP. This is a minor issue that would only increase the practical
    limit by <span class="code">1</span> for that IP, but it is incorrect behavior.
</p>

<p>
    In an unrelated change, the mask for string length has been corrected in the <span class="code">Message</span>
    class. This corrects some issues with reading debug responses with long lines.
