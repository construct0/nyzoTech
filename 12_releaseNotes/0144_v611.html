<h1>Nyzo 611: further CycleDigest improvements</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 611
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/f6afe67762bc7a1fb26e14e927f31d9432a1b127"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds further improvements and tests for the
    <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> class.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version does not affect any run modes. It contains foundational work for future functional changes.
</p>

<p>
    This version further develops the <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> class that was introduced in
    <a href="v596">version 596</a> and previously updated in versions <a href="v598">598</a> and
    <a href="v610">610</a>. This version adds a flag to indicate whether a <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> has
    enough history to validate all proof-of-diversity rules, and it reduces the block history required to calculate a
    <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> by a full cycle. Testing is also expanded.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">CycleDigest</span>, the constant <span class="code">requiredCyclesForCompleteness</span> was
    added. Cycle digests need four full cycles to allow the proof-of-diversity rules to be evaluated.
</p>

<p>
    A new <span class="code">complete</span> field was added to indicate whether the object has the full information
    required of a <span class="code">CycleDigest</span>. Ultimately, we would like to perform another blockchain update
    that stores the hash of the digest at the frozen edge, which would ensure that a complete
    <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> is always available at the frozen edge, eliminating the need for this flag.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> constructor is now <span class="code">public</span> instead of
    <span class="code">private</span>. Currently, <span class="code">CycleDigestTest</span> is the only other class
    creating <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> objects, but plans are in place for a
    <span class="code">CycleDigestManager</span> class that will likely also need to create instances of
    <span class="code">CycleDigest</span>.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">calculateCycleStartIndices()</span> method changed to
    <span class="code">calculateCycleStartIndicesAndCompleteness()</span>. This method and the
    <span class="code">calculateCycleLengths()</span> method now both return <span class="code">void</span>, and the
    calculated values are stored in the object fields within these methods.
</p>

<p>
    Instead of using the array length when removing excess identifiers, the
    <span class="code">requiredCyclesForCompleteness</span> constant is now used to improve readability.
</p>

<p>
    To avoid spamming the console, the <span class="code">newVerifierStates</span> are no longer printed within the
    constructor, and the continuity state now considers the new <span class="code">complete</span> flag.
</p>

<img src="images/0611/rn_611_1.png" alt="RN_611 image 1" class="code-image" style="width: 390px; max-height: 320px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">print()</span> method no longer accepts the new-verifier states as an argument, instead using
    the fields available to the instance method. The old method of printing cycles is used for digests with up to 20
    heights.
</p>

<img src="images/0611/rn_611_2.png" alt="RN_611 image 2" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 190px;">

<p>
    A condensed version is now displayed for digests handling longer cycles.
</p>

<img src="images/0611/rn_611_3.png" alt="RN_611 image 3" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 380px;">

<p>
    A convenience method of <span class="code">isNewVerifier()</span> was added for parity with the
    <span class="code">CycleInformation</span> class.
</p>

<img src="images/0611/rn_611_4.png" alt="RN_611 image 4" class="code-image" style="width: 370px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    A <span class="code">suggestedBlockHeight</span> is now passed to the <span class="code">digestForNextBlock()</span>
    method. This is used to allow a <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> to be built starting an any height, without
    the onerous requirement of starting at the Genesis block.
</p>

<img src="images/0611/rn_611_5.png" alt="RN_611 image 5" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 230px;">

<p>
    The renamed <span class="code">calculateCycleStartIndicesAndCompleteness()</span> method now uses the
    <span class="code">requiredCyclesForCompletness</span> constant to define the
    <span class="code">cycleStartIndices</span> array length. This array is now one element shorter than it was
    previously. Results are stored in the appropriate object fields, and the cycle count and completeness are displayed
    for debugging purposes.
</p>

<img src="images/0611/rn_611_6.png" alt="RN_611 image 6" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 290px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">calculateCycleLengths()</span> method, the <span class="code">cycleLengths</span> array is
    now the same size as the <span class="code">cycleStartIndices</span> array. The
    <span class="code">cycleLengths</span> array did not change size. This is an adjustment due to the removal of an
    unnecessary element from the <span class="code">cycleStartIndices</span> array.
</p>

<p>
    A reference to the <span class="code">cycleLengths</span> array is now stored in the class field in this method
    instead of being returned. This follows the design of the
    <span class="code">calculateCycleStartIndicesAndCompleteness</span> method.
</p>

<img src="images/0611/rn_611_7.png" alt="RN_611 image 7" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 220px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">isComplete()</span> accessor method was added.
</p>

<img src="images/0611/rn_611_8.png" alt="RN_611 image 8" class="code-image" style="width: 170px; max-height: 70px;">

<p>
    A method for reading a <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> from a file was added. To support this method, the
    <span class="code">fileForHeight()</span> method standardizes locations of <span class="code">CycleDigest</span>
    files.
</p>

<img src="images/0611/rn_611_9.png" alt="RN_611 image 9" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 190px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">CycleDigest.toString()</span> method now includes the completeness and length of the
    identifier list.
</p>

<img src="images/0611/rn_611_10.png" alt="RN_611 image 10" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    At the beginning of <span class="code">CycleDigestTest.main()</span>, the <span class="code">testHardCoded()</span>
    method is now invoked.
</p>

<p>
    The block height is now passed to the <span class="code">digestForNextBlock()</span> method, although the value is
    redundant and unused when the cycle digest provided to the method is non-null.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, completeness is checked on all digests created from the block files.
</p>

<img src="images/0611/rn_611_11.png" alt="RN_611 image 11" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 420px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">CycleDigestTest.testHardCoded()</span> method checks some simple digests to examine specific
    behaviors of the <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> class that might not be captured in real scenarios on the
    Nyzo blockchain.
</p>

<img src="images/0611/rn_611_12.png" alt="RN_611 image 12" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 190px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">CycleDigestTest.testDigest()</span> method checks a single digest produced from a character
    string. Each character in a string represents a verifier identifier, and all of the expected parameters of the
    cycle digest are specified and checked against computed parameters.
</p>

<img src="images/0611/rn_611_13.png" alt="RN_611 image 13" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 290px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">CycleDigestTest.check()</span> methods now have color coding to provide more obvious
    feedback on failed tests. An overload for comparing two <span class="code">Object</span>s was added.
</p>
