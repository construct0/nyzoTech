<h1>Nyzo Chrome 3: Multiple items</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo Chrome extension version 3
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/chromeExtension/commit/7e8877087c2bc5cae32dfca2584c17e8ab3bf415"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) improves support for including multiple Micropay items in a single web
    page.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">content</span> script, the tag from the request is now passed back to the document along
    with the transaction and supplemental transaction.

<p>
    The description was updated in the manifest. This should have been updated in version 2.

<p>
    In the <span class="code">popup</span> script, the tag from the micropay configuration is now passed back to the tab
    along with the unique reference key. This is redundant, as the unique reference key is a concatenation of the
    receiver identifier and the tag, but adding a parameter is much more reasonable and readable than extracting the tag
    from the key when the message is received.

<p>
    The <a href="/micropay/multipleItemExample">multiple-item Micropay example</a> takes advantage of this tag to handle
    both article and image content on the same page. This was possible with version 2 of the extension, but it would
    have required tag extraction from the transaction sender data.
