<h1>Nyzo 542: blockchain v1</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 542
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/be8f835f9234789c7bf9cbcc0309d5cf025bbd61"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) completes the v1 blockchain changes and basic cycle-transaction
    functionality.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects all run modes.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BalanceListManager</span>, the blockchain version is now provided when calling
    <span class="code">Block.balanceListForNextBlock()</span>. The blockchain version is stored in both the block and
    the balance list.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_0.png" alt="RN_542 code 0" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BalanceManager</span>, several calls to <span class="code">System.out.println()</span> have
    been replaced with corresponding calls to <span class="code">LogUtil.println()</span>.
    <span class="code">LogUtil</span> is a primitive, lightweight logging solution that currently provides awareness of
    the run mode and optional time stamping.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_1.png" alt="RN_542 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">approvedTransactionsForBlock()</span>, type-checking of transactions now accounts for
    coin-generation transactions in block 0 and cycle transactions in blockchain version 1.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_2.png" alt="RN_542 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    Enforcement of cycle-transaction rules has been added immediately before enforcement of the rules for locked
    accounts.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_3.png" alt="RN_542 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 470px;">

<p>
    In cycle transactions, the initiator of the transaction is identified in the sender field. However, for the purposes
    of transferring funds, the sender is the cycle account (<span class="code">0000...0002</span>).
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_4.png" alt="RN_542 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 450px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">enforceCycleTransactionRules()</span> method, as its name indicates, is responsible for the
    rules specific to approval or rejection of cycle transactions. There rules are deliberately strict. The cycle
    account will likely be the single largest account in Nyzo for as long as Nyzo exists, so it will be a large target
    for those wishing to steal coins. The first two enforcements are simple: cycle transactions are not allowed before
    blockchain version 1, and cycle transactions over &cap;100,000 are not allowed.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_5.png" alt="RN_542 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    The remainder of the method deals with the signatures of the transaction. Each transaction must be signed by at
    least 75% of the cycle. This logic errs on the side of strictness, rejecting transactions for any deviations from
    expectation, such as inclusion of duplicate signatures.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_6.png" alt="RN_542 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Block</span>, <span class="code">maximumBlockchainVersion</span> has been increased to
    <span class="code">1</span>. Its visibility has also been changed to <span class="code">public</span> to allow
    access from <span class="code">BlockchainVersionManager</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_7.png" alt="RN_542 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">balanceListForNextBlock()</span>, <span class="code">blockchainVersion</span> has been changed
    to a method argument. Previously, it was anchored at <span class="code">0</span>, which prevented blockchain
    version upgrades.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_8.png" alt="RN_542 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    When adjusting account balances, the cycle account is used as the source of funds for cycle transactions.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_9.png" alt="RN_542 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    One percent of organic transaction fees, rounded down to the nearest &micro;1, are transferred to the cycle account
    in blockchain version 1.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_10.png" alt="RN_542 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    Three conditions related to the blockchain version have been added to the <span class="code">chainScore()</span>
    method. The first assigns an invalid score for invalid versions. The second is the upgrade mechanism &mdash; when
    the blockchain is eligible for upgrade, blocks that do not upgrade receive a small penalty. The third condition
    penalizes improperly timed upgrade blocks. To avoid prolonged slow-downs due to repeatedly failed upgrades, the
    blockchain is only designed to attempt an upgrade once every 50 blocks.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_11.png" alt="RN_542 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 575px;">

<p>
    The blockchain version has been added to the <span class="code">Block.toString()</span> result.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_12.png" alt="RN_542 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 530px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockFileConsolidator</span>, calls to <span class="code">NotificationUtil.send()</span> have
    been replaced with calls to <span class="code">LogUtil.println()</span>. The
    <span class="code">NotificationUtil</span> class was sparsely used and not properly maintained, so it has been
    eliminated in this version.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_13.png" alt="RN_542 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager</span>, <span class="code">NotificationUtil.send()</span> has been replaced by
    <span class="code">LogUtil.println()</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_14.png" alt="RN_542 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    Calls to <span class="code">Block.balanceListForNextBlock()</span> now include the blockchain version.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_15.png" alt="RN_542 code 15" class="code-image" style="width: 560px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlockchainVersionManager</span> has been implemented. To allow the upgrade process to be tested
    quickly on a testnet, an alternate activation height of <span class="code">100</span> was added for when the
    verifier is running in testnet mode. The <span class="code">upgradePending()</span> method is used by the
    <span class="code">Verifier</span> class to determine whether an upgrade block should be produced. The other two
    methods are used for scoring blocks, as was explained above.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_16.png" alt="RN_542 code 16" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">CycleTransactionManager</span> is a simple class that tracks pending cycle transactions. The
    transactions are stored in a map. The map is keyed on initiator identifier, so there may be no more than 1
    transaction proposed by a single verifier in the map at a time. The map is persisted to a file shortly after each
    time it changes, and the persisted data is loaded into memory on initialization by the
    <span class="code">loadMap()</span> method. The <span class="code">mapHasChanged</span> field is used to avoid
    unnecessary file writes when the information in the map has not changed.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_17.png" alt="RN_542 code 17" class="code-image" style="width: 545px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">registerTransaction()</span> method is used to add transactions to the map. Like the
    <span class="code">TransactionPool.addTransaction()</span> method, this method returns a boolean value to indicate
    whether the transaction was added, and it also accepts <span class="code">StringBuilder</span> objects to
    communicate error and warning messages to the client of the method.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_18.png" alt="RN_542 code 18" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">registerSignature()</span> method adds signatures to cycle transactions in the map. Cycle
    signatures are referenced to the initiator identifier when they are transmitted, and they are checked for validity
    several times before being approved.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_19.png" alt="RN_542 code 19" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">getTransactions()</span> method provides a view of all transactions in the map. This is used
    in responses of type <span class="code">CycleTransactionListResponse_50</span> in the process of listing and signing
    cycle transactions from the client.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_20.png" alt="RN_542 code 20" class="code-image" style="width: 300px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">transactionsForHeight()</span> method provides all cycle transactions in the map for the
    specified height. This is used by <span class="code">Verifier</span> when assembling new blocks.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_21.png" alt="RN_542 code 21" class="code-image" style="width: 450px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">performMaintenance()</span> method removes transactions below the current frozen edge. Also,
    if the map has changed since the last time this method was executed, the map is persisted to file.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_22.png" alt="RN_542 code 22" class="code-image" style="width: 420px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">persistMap()</span> method writes the map to file. Cycle transactions are expected to
    typically require several days to gather enough signatures for approval, so losing knowledge of these transactions
    on verifier restarts would be problematic.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_23.png" alt="RN_542 code 23" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">loadMap()</span>, the transaction file is read, and all the transactions it contains are
    registered with the <span class="code">CycleTransactionManager</span>. This file uses the same binary transaction
    format used for messages, prefixed by a single 4-byte integer to indicate the number of transactions in the file.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_24.png" alt="RN_542 code 24" class="code-image" style="width: 440px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">transactionPoolLength</span> constant has been eliminated from
    <span class="code">FieldByteSize</span>. To improve readability of the code and reduce clutter, infrequently used
    byte-size constants such as this are being replaced by <span class="code">unnamed</span> constants
    (<span class="code">unnamedByte</span>, <span class="code">unnamedDouble</span>,
    <span class="code">unnamedInteger</span>).
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_25.png" alt="RN_542 code 25" class="code-image" style="width: 290px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">MeshListener</span>, the class used in <span class="code">TransactionPoolResponse14</span>
    messages has been renamed from <span class="code">TransactionPoolResponse</span> to
    <span class="code">TransactionListResponse</span> to indicate the expanded use of the class in this version. This
    does not change the structure of this message, and it remains compatible will all previous versions of the Nyzo
    software.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_26.png" alt="RN_542 code 26" class="code-image" style="width: 560px;">

<p>
    Responses have been added for messages of type <span class="code">CycleTransactionSignature_47</span> and
    <span class="code">CycleTransactionListRequest_49</span>. A new response was not required for cycle transactions,
    because they use the existing <span class="code">Transaction5</span> message type.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_27.png" alt="RN_542 code 27" class="code-image" style="width: 450px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message.processContent()</span>, renaming of <span class="code">TransactionPoolResponse</span>
    to <span class="code">TransactionListResponse</span> has been completed, and the new message types are processed.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_28.png" alt="RN_542 code 28" class="code-image" style="width: 420px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">MessageType</span> enumeration, the comments regarding elimination of
    <span class="code">MissingBlockVoteRequest23</span> and <span class="code">MissingBlockVoteResponse24</span> have
    been removed. Elimination of these messages had deleterious effects on mesh connectedness and consensus, so their
    use was restored in version 537.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_29.png" alt="RN_542 code 29" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    Message types have been added for the new messages required for the process of signing cycle transactions.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_30.png" alt="RN_542 code 30" class="code-image" style="width: 260px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">NodeManager</span>, use of <span class="code">NotificationUtil</span> has been replaced with
    <span class="code">LogUtil</span>, and <span class="code">getMeshSize()</span> has been renamed to
    <span class="code">getMeshSizeForGenesisCycleVoting()</span>. This method was only intended to used for
    Genesis-cycle voting, and the name change was implemented to ensure that the method was not mistakenly used for
    other purposes. To ensure that multiple entries for a single identifier do not produce an unattainable voting
    threshold in the Genesis cycle, the number of unique identifiers in the mesh is now returned by this method.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_31.png" alt="RN_542 code 31" class="code-image" style="width: 570px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">SeedTransactionManager</span>, <span class="code">s3UrlForFile()</span> has been renamed to
    <span class="code">urlForFile()</span> to reflect that the URL produced is no longer necessarily an s3 URL. For
    testnet operation, files are retrieved directly from the testnet server to simplify the process of resetting the
    testnet blockchain.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_32.png" alt="RN_542 code 32" class="code-image" style="width: 440px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">TestnetGenesisBlockCreator</span> script, creation of the Genesis block has been moved
    from the <span class="code">main()</span> method to a method called <span class="code">createGenesisBlock()</span>.
    This method is now called from the <span class="code">main()</span> method, so behavior of the script is unchanged.
    This modification was made to allow other scripts to easily reuse this script's functionality. Also, a blockchain
    version of <span class="code">0</span> is now specified for the Genesis block. This does not change the behavior of
    the script, either. The "version 0" blockchain is simply the versionless blockchain that has existed since the
    inception of Nyzo.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_33.png" alt="RN_542 code 33" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Transaction</span>, a constant was added to specify a maximum cycle transaction amount of
    &cap;100,000.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_34.png" alt="RN_542 code 34" class="code-image" style="width: 510px;">

<p>
    In the static method for rebuilding cycle transactions, all typical transaction fields are now provided. While
    there is no reason for a cycle transaction to use a previous hash other than the Genesis block, there is also no
    reason not to allow another hash to be used. Also, the <span class="code">senderIdentifier</span> field now stores
    the identifier of the initiator of the cycle transaction, and the <span class="code">signature</span> field now
    stores that verifier's signature of the transaction.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_35.png" alt="RN_542 code 35" class="code-image" style="width: 520px;">

<p>
    Analogous changes have been made to the method that builds new cycle transactions.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_36.png" alt="RN_542 code 36" class="code-image" style="width: 560px;">

<p>
    Cycle transactions do not produce fees.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_37.png" alt="RN_542 code 37" class="code-image" style="width: 350px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">getByteSize()</span>, space is now allocated for the list of cycle signatures in cycle
    transactions.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_38.png" alt="RN_542 code 38" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">getBytes()</span>, the cycle transaction type has been added to the condition that serializes
    most transaction fields.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_39.png" alt="RN_542 code 39" class="code-image" style="width: 380px;">

<p>
    Cycle transaction signatures are ordered by verifier identifier. While any ordering of these signatures would be
    suitable, consistency of ordering is necessary to preserve block signature integrity.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_40.png" alt="RN_542 code 40" class="code-image" style="width: 490px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">fromByteBuffer()</span>, several reads of <span class="code">byte</span> arrays have been
    replaced with calls to the <span class="code">Message.getByteArray()</span> convenience method to improve
    readability. Also, the cycle transaction type has been added to the condition that reads most of the fields of the
    transaction.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_41.png" alt="RN_542 code 41" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    Cycle signatures are now deserialized for cycle transactions.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_42.png" alt="RN_542 code 42" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">signatureIsValid()</span> method now processes cycle transactions. However, it is important
    to note that a <span class="code">true</span> result from this method for a cycle does not mean that the transaction
    will necessarily be accepted into the blockchain. It only means that the transaction was signed properly by the
    initiator of the transaction.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_43.png" alt="RN_542 code 43" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    An overload of <span class="code">signatureIsValid()</span> was added for checking cycle signatures.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_44.png" alt="RN_542 code 44" class="code-image" style="width: 430px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">addSignature()</span> method attaches a new cycle signature to cycle transactions. Some basic
    checks are performed to ensure the signature is relevant to the transaction.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_45.png" alt="RN_542 code 45" class="code-image" style="width: 560px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">filterSignatures()</span> method removes cycle transaction signatures that are no longer
    relevant to the transaction. This method is called just before an attempt is made to incorporate a cycle transaction
    into a block.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_46.png" alt="RN_542 code 46" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">getCycleSignatures()</span> method exposes the cycle signatures to other classes, and the
    <span class="code">toString()</span> method was added to aid in debugging.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_47.png" alt="RN_542 code 47" class="code-image" style="width: 450px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager</span>, downgrade blocks are rejected. Also, the maximum number of blocks
    retained at any height has been reduced from 500 to 10.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_48.png" alt="RN_542 code 48" class="code-image" style="width: 570px;">

<p>
    The new method name is now called to determine the voting pool size for the Genesis cycle, and logging has been
    added when unable to freeze a block in the Genesis cycle. The testnet was used extensively and reset repeatedly to
    test the blockchain upgrade process, and a reliable Genesis cycle was important for efficient testing.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_49.png" alt="RN_542 code 49" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">fetchMissingBlock()</span>, one <span content="code">NotificationUtil</span> message and one
    <span content="code">System.out</span> message have been changed to <span class="code">LogUtil</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_50.png" alt="RN_542 code 50" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Verifier</span>, the maps used to track which blocks have been created and transmitted have
    been replaced with <span class="code">Block</span> variables to store created blocks and
    <span class="code">boolean</span> variables to track whether those blocks have been transmitted. The maps were
    useful when Nyzo would work on multiple heights at a time (in the previous blockchain), but they were overly
    complicated for this blockchain, and an additional set of maps would have been necessary to handle the upgrade
    process.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_51.png" alt="RN_542 code 51" class="code-image" style="width: 400px;">

<p>
    The Genesis block, like seed transactions, is now fetched directly from the testnet web server for testnet mode.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_52.png" alt="RN_542 code 52" class="code-image" style="width: 470px;">

<p>
    Elimination of the block-tracking maps has eliminated the need to clean up those maps. Instead, the new
    <span class="code">Block</span> fields are set to null when a block is frozen.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_53.png" alt="RN_542 code 53" class="code-image" style="width: 570px;">

<p>
    The newer <span class="code">BlockManager.getFrozenEdge()</span> method is now used to fetch the frozen-edge block.
    In addition to creating a block for the current version of the blockchain, a block is also created to attempt to
    upgrade the blockchain when an opportunity to do so arises.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_54.png" alt="RN_542 code 54" class="code-image" style="width: 560px;">

<p>
    The current-version block and upgrade block are both transmitted when their scores indicate that they should be
    transmitted. The behavior is unchanged for the current-version block; the only behavior change here is the addition
    of upgrade-block transmission.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_55.png" alt="RN_542 code 55" class="code-image" style="width: 570px;">

<p>
    When a block is frozen, the fields that track which blocks have been created and transmitted are reset. Also,
    maintenance of the <span class="code">CycleTransactionManager</span> has been added.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_56.png" alt="RN_542 code 56" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">extendBlock()</span>, an option to upgrade the blockchain has been added. The
    <span class="code">upgradeBlockchainVersion</span> option is passed to the
    <span class="code">createNextBlock()</span> method, the block is stored in the appropriate field after it is
    created.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_57.png" alt="RN_542 code 57" class="code-image" style="width: 560px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">createNextBlock()</span> method now has an option for upgrading the blockchain version, and
    approved cycle transactions are now incorporated into the block. Detailed logging indicates reasons for failure to
    include any cycle transactions that are provided by the <span class="code">CycleTransactionManager</span>.
</p>

<p>
    The blockchain version is calculated just before balance-list creation. In the case of an upgrade, the version is
    incremented. The version of the balance list is then used for block creation.
</p>

<p>
    Verifier initialization time is now exposed via an accessor method for use in the private status response.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">ClientTransactionUtil</span>, a method has been added for sending new cycle transactions to
    the cycle. Successful transmission are tracked, and each transmission is retried once if the initial transmission
    is not successful.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">sendCycleTransactionSignature()</span> method follows the same process to send
    cycle-transaction signatures to the cycle. The process of sending and signing cycle transactions will be difficult
    and tedious at first. Future versions will work to improve the usability of this process.
</p>

<p>
    Three commands have been added to the client to facilitate the cycle-transaction process.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">CycleTransactionListCommand</span> shows all available cycle transactions. If a key of an
    in-cycle verifier is provided, the cycle transactions are fetched from that verifier and cached locally. Otherwise,
    just the locally cached transactions are displayed.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">CycleTransactionSendCommand</span> sends a new cycle transaction. The user process for this is
    the same as sending a standard transaction.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_65.png" alt="RN_542 code 65" class="code-image" style="width: 510px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">CycleTransactionSignCommand</span> signs a cycle transaction initiated by another in-cycle
    verifier. The transaction is specified by index, which is determined by running the
    <span class="code">CycleTransactionListCommand</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_66.png" alt="RN_542 code 66" class="code-image" style="width: 480px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">CycleTransactionSignature</span>, as its name indicates, encapsulates signatures for cycle
    transactions. Note that the initiator identifier is specified, not the initiator signature. However, as each
    initiator is only allowed to have one proposed transaction in the system at a time, and signatures will only
    validate for the messages they sign, this is not a problem.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">CycleTransactionSignatureResponse</span> provides a simple
    <span class="code">true</span>/<span class="code">false</span> response indicating whether a cycle transaction
    signature was accepted by a verifier.
</p>

<p>
    Verifier initialization time has been added to the private status response. Notification budget has been removed.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">TransactionPoolResponse</span> has been renamed and extended to accommodate the
    cycle-transaction list. It has also been restricted to self-signed requests for both standard- and cycle-transaction
    lists. This is a behavior change for standard-transaction lists, but there is no good reason to deliver these lists
    to all those who request them.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_70.png" alt="RN_542 code 70" class="code-image" style="width: 470px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">TransactionResponse</span> has been modified to accommodate cycle transactions. Standard
    transactions are still registered with <span class="code">TransactionPool</span>, but cycle transactions are
    registered with <span class="code">CycleTransactionManager</span>.
</p>

<p>
    The sentinel always produces a block with the same version as the previous block. The scoring system ensures that
    failure to upgrade the blockchain version will never cause a verifier to be removed from the cycle.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_72.png" alt="RN_542 code 72" class="code-image" style="width: 495px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">NotificationUtil</span> class has been completely removed.
</p>

<img src="images/0542/rn_542_73.png" alt="RN_542 code 73" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">UpdateUtil</span>, a call to <span class="code">MeshListener.closeSockets()</span> has been
    added to the <span class="code">terminate()</span> method. The application will not terminate properly if these
    sockets are not closed. The call to this method was no longer necessary in the <span class="code">reset()</span>
    method, as the <span class="code">reset()</span> method calls the <span class="code">terminate()</span> method.
</p>
