<h1>Nyzo 532: Micropay flow&thinsp;/&thinsp;tracking</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 532
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/cdab23872a9df234633be597635e152f5a268f4b"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) improves the Micropay flow and blockchain tracking.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the web listener in all run modes, though not significantly. The primary changes are in the
    Micropay server. As the client and Micropay server share the <span class="code">ClientDataManager</span> class for
    tracking the blockchain, the client also benefits from the blockchain-tracking improvements of this version.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">ClientDataManager</span>, <span class="code">minimumReinitializationInterval</span> and
    <span class="code">reinitializationThreshold</span> constants have been added. While these both have the same value,
    they have different meanings. The <span class="code">minimumReinitializationInterval</span> constant dictates that
    reinitialization cannot happen more than once every 10 minutes, and the
    <span class="code">reinitializationThreshold</span> constant dictates that reinitialization is only necessary if the
    verification timestamp of the local frozen edge is more than 10 minutes old.
</p>

<p>
    In the client data manager loop, <span class="code">ChainInitializationManager.initializeFrozenEdge()</span> is
    performed again if the age of the frozen-edge verification timestamp is greater than the threshold. To prevent
    frequent reinitialization and potential blacklisting if blockchain processing has stalled, a minimum interval
    on reinitialization is also applied.
</p>

<p>
    This reinitialization process is especially important for a Micropay server. If the server in unable to track the
    blockchain, it will eventually be unable to produce valid Micropay transactions. Unlike the client, which is
    currently designed to be run interactively, the Micropay server is designed to run unattended.
</p>

<p>
    A server ping page has been added. While the path is the same as the client ping page, the returned page is
    different.
</p>

<img src="images/0532/rn_532_2.png" alt="RN_532 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 490px;">

<p>
    Some small changes were made to HTML rendering to produce more compliant output.
</p>

<p>
    The receiver ID and sender data were removed from the Micropay approval page. These were useful to demonstrate the
    system in the initial Micropay release, but they unnecessarily clutter the page.
</p>

<p>
    While there is concern that a Micropay receiver might ask a sender to sign inappropriate sender data, allowing the
    user to review the metadata does not robustly address this problem. However, use of the hash of the sender data in
    transaction signature calculation does provide a robust and complete solution to this problem.
</p>

<p>
    The Micropay approval page now appears as follows.
</p>

<img src="images/0532/rn_532_5.png" alt="RN_532 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 160px;">

<p>
    A <span class="code">cancel</span> query parameter with a value of <span class="code">y</span> has been added for
    the cancellation link. This link typically returns the user to a server authorization page. To eliminate a user
    step from the process, the server authorization page now redirects to the client approval page by default. This
    parameter is used to prevent this automatic redirection when the page is reloaded due to cancellation.
</p>

<img src="images/0532/rn_532_6.png" alt="RN_532 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 450px;">

<p>
    The server authorization page now processes the <span class="code">cancel</span> parameter.
</p>

<img src="images/0532/rn_532_7.png" alt="RN_532 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 460px;">

<p>
    The server authorization page has been revised to provide a simpler experience, along with some minor layout
    changes. Most notably, if an error or cancellation are not present, the page automatically redirects to the
    client authorization page.
</p>

<p>
    This results in the following user process for typical Micropay-monetized content. This is only one additional step
    beyond typical non-monetized content, and it is a drastically simpler user experience than most subscription-based
    monetization schemes.
</p>

<ul style="font-family: sans-serif;">
    <li>user clicks on content link</li>
    <li>user clicks on authorization button on local Micropay authorization page</li>
    <li>user receives content</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In <span class="code">WebListener</span>, the ping page has been added to the Micropay server run mode. To allow
    overrides using the existing dynamic mechanism, this endpoint is added before the dynamic mappings are added. This
    page displays the IP the server sees, which can be helpful for a user who is trying to see why IP-based
    authorization is behaving oddly.
</p>

<p>
    In a future version of the Micropay server, IP-based authorization will be replaced with cookie-based authorization.

<p>
    In <span class="code">Head</span>, the standard metadata has been structured with the <span class="code">Meta</span>
    class. Also, the <span class="code">doctype</span> tag has been updated for HTML5.
</p>

<img src="images/0532/rn_532_10.png" alt="RN_532 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 480px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">HtmlTag</span>, the <span class="code">includeClosingTag</span> option has been added to allow
    proper rendering of the <span class="code">meta</span> tag.
</p>

<img src="images/0532/rn_532_11.png" alt="RN_532 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 300px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">Meta</span> class has been added to allow structuring of <span class="code">meta</span>
    elements.
