<h1>Nyzo 504: consensus monitoring</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 504
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/b626c1277bd5d0cfc412c9504c86f0708f5c5682"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) improves visibility into consensus issues.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version only affects the verifier, and it does not affect the behavior of the verifier in any significant way.
    It only improves visibility into consensus issues. There is no need to update if you do not find this version
    interesting.
</p>

<p>
    The Nyzo blockchain has recently stalled three times when a new verifier was added during periods of exceptional
    stress for the cycle. The data we collected during the stalls was insufficient for explaining these stalls, and
    they do not appear to have been the result of direct failures in the consensus algorithm. In all three cases, the
    consensus algorithm was able to identify a clear winner with more than 50% of the vote, but the natural progression
    from 50% to over 75% did not occur.
</p>

<p>
    This build adds a field to the status response to explain why the verifier cast its latest block vote. It also
    corrects and improves the <span class="code">ConsensusTallyStatusResponse</span> and adds a script to query for
    this response.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager</span> class, the <span class="code">voteDescription</span> variable
    has been added. This variable is updated every time the block vote is recalculated, and it tells the logic that
    was used to arrive at the vote.
</p>

<p>
    The description is exposed through the <span class="code">getVoteDescription()</span> method, and it is included in
    the status response as the <span class="code">block vote</span> field.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">ConsensusTallyStatusResponse</span> class has been reworked to display only the votes at the
    height one past the frozen edge. In an older version of Nyzo, the cycle would be working on consensus at multiple
    heights at the same time. This allowed long sections of the blockchain to be frozen in a single operation when the
    blockchain was behind. While this was a useful mechanism, it was also a very complicated mechanism, and it
    ultimately resulted in the collapse of the first Nyzo blockchain. In the current Nyzo blockchain, the cycle only
    works on consensus at one height at a time. While the <span class="code">BlockVoteManager</span> still stores
    multiple heights of votes, the only &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; height is the height immediately above the frozen
    edge.
</p>

<p>
    In the serialized form of this response, the field that stores the number of lines has been changed from one byte
    to two. While this does make the new form of the message incompatible with the previous form, we have not introduced
    a new message number for this message,as we did when the <span class="code">BootstrapResponse</span> was updated.
    We did this for two reasons. The message is a debugging/informational message, so an incompatibility does not
    affect system operation. Also, the message was already broken, and there is no reason to maintain compatibility with
    a message that does not work.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">ConsensusTallyStatusRequestScript</span> has been added for querying the consensus tally.
    It operates much like the other scripts, but it has the additional option of running in loopback mode if a private
    seed is not provided.
</p>

<p>
    To run the script on your verifier, ssh to the verifier, navigate to the
    <span class="filename">nyzoVerifier</span> directory, and run the following command:
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo java -jar build/libs/nyzoVerifier-1.0.jar co.nyzo.verifier.scripts.ConsensusTallyStatusRequestScript
</p>

<p>
    The output should either be a long list of nicknames and votes, followed by a shorter list of vote totals for each
    hash, or a message saying <span class="code">*** no votes available for height XX ***</span>. Both outputs indicate
    proper operation. It is perfectly normal for no votes to be available just past the frozen edge if a block was
    recently frozen.
</p>

<p>
    If you want to run the script from a system that is not an in-cycle verifier, provide the private seed of an
    in-cycle verifier. The script will query verifier0.nyzo.co to obtain the current mesh, and it will find your
    verifier in the mesh and send a self-signed message to it. The command for this is similar to the previous command:
</p>

<p class="command">
    sudo java -jar build/libs/nyzoVerifier-1.0.jar co.nyzo.verifier.scripts.ConsensusTallyStatusRequestScript [seed of
    in-cycle verifier]
</p>

<p>
    An out-of-cycle verifier will also respond to this message, but out-of-cycle verifiers do not receive broadcasts of
    block votes, so the response will generally be uninteresting. Also, be sure that the verifier you are querying is
    running this version of the code or later, or the response will be invalid.
