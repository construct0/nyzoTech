<h1>Nyzo 641: NyzoStringEncoder fix</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 641
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/1f7df4a6d955078c549049b967b1c42b632d2e66"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) corrects a bug in
    <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>String<wbr>Encoder</span>.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version does not affect any run modes, but it improves robustness of the code.
</p>

<p>
    We are currently working on improving adoption of Nyzo. This includes work on the
    <a href="/nyzoScripts" class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script</a> functionality, and it also includes development of the
    <a href="/setupInstructions/wordpressPlugin">WordPress plugin</a> to bring Nyzo Micropay to WordPress.
</p>

<p>
    In development of tests for the WordPress plugin, we updated some equivalent tests in the Java codebase. In these
    test updates, we identified and fixed an issue with the <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>String<wbr>Encoder</span>.
    This version includes the test update and its resulting fix.
</p>

<p>
    The fix is in <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>String<wbr>Encoder.<wbr>byte<wbr>Array<wbr>For<wbr>Encoded<wbr>
    String()</span>. In this method, the result array length is rounded down instead of up. Rounding up was never a
    problem in current decoder use cases due to variable-length checksums in Nyzo strings, but it was a problem in the
    more general case of decoding arrays of arbitrary lengths.

<p>
    <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>String<wbr>Test.<wbr>test<wbr>Encoder()</span> was added to
    <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>String<wbr>Test.<wbr>run()</span>.

<p>
    <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>String<wbr>Test.<wbr>test<wbr>Encoder()</span> tests encoding and decoding of 30 byte
    arrays to and from Nyzo string encodings. These are evenly distributed with byte array lengths from 1 to 6 bytes.
    When this method was first written, byte arrays of length 3 and byte arrays of length 6 decoded properly. However,
    lengths of 1, 2, 4, and 5 all failed with exceptions due to out-of-range indices with the previous rounding. With
    updated rounding, all lengths encode and decode properly with correct values and correct lengths.
