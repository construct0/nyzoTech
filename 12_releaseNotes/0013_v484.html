<h1>Nyzo 484: node-join messages</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 484
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/7572d8360fc019e4669a39e01110eb95d871f695"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) improves node management for the verifier.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version does not alter behavior of the sentinel. The classes and methods modified are only used by the
    verifier.
</p>

<p>
    As the cycle and mesh grow, the importance of managing network traffic increases. Previously, node-join messages
    were typically sent in short bursts. These short bursts could potentially trigger anti-DDoS protections on some
    cloud providers, and they could also result in excessive memory consumption. This update changes the process for
    sending node-join messages, replacing most of the short bursts with a small number of messages just after each
    block is frozen.
</p>

<p>
    This update also corrects an issue in which inactive in-cycle nodes would never be removed from the mesh, and it
    improves reporting about mesh in the status response.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">NodeManager</span> class, the method that would send node-join messages on demand has
    been replaced with a method that adds the requested IP addresses and port to a queue. The queue is stored in a map
    on IP address, so if the same address is added to the queue multiple times before the first request is sent, the
    new entry will overwrite the old entry and prevent the request from being sent multiple times. This is the desired
    behavior, especially in the bootstrap process, where node-join messages are sent to every node in the meshes
    returned by all trusted entry points.
</p>

<p>
    The method that sends node-join requests sends a specified number of requests on demand, selecting elements
    arbitrarily from the queue.
</p>

<p>
    In the verifier bootstrap process, requests are enqueued for all nodes returned by all trusted entry points. Then,
    this method is called with a negative value, which causes the entire queue to be sent at once. While this does
    cause a burst in traffic as it did before, this is at a point in the process where the verifier is not yet sending
    block votes, so the peak outgoing traffic of the verifier is still lower than it was before.
</p>

<p>
    In normal verifier operation, a call to request the mesh is made once each time a block is frozen. Then, up to 10
    requests are sent from the queue.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">NodeManager</span> method that requests the mesh maintains a counter to ensure that the
    queue is repopulated no more than once per cycle, and a check is performed to ensure the queue is not repopulated
    unless it is empty. The requirement that the queue be empty before it is repopulated is important, as the queue
    uses a FIRO (first-in-random-out) behavior, and this condition helps to ensure that all nodes in the mesh are
    queried at a reasonable interval. This method, when executed at an inconvenient time when block votes were also
    being broadcast, was especially problematic before this update.
</p>

<p>
    Also in the <span class="code">NodeManager</span> class, a condition was removed that had prevented in-cycle
    verifiers from being marked as inactive. This condition was initially added on the assumption that a verifier
    would eventually be removed from the cycle if it was inactive, but it did not take into account multiple
    instances with the same identifier, changed IP addresses, or the sentinel.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">removeNodeFromMesh()</span> method has been renamed to
    <span class="code">markNodeAsInactive()</span> to better reflect its purpose. Also, a check is now performed so
    that an inactive node is not marked again with a newer inactive timestamp.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">updateActiveVerifiersAndRemoveOldNodes()</span> method has been updated with an additional
    set to track in-cycle verifiers, and a field has been added to display any in-cycle verifiers that are currently
    unknown to the node manager. The <span class="code">activeVerifiers</span> set has also been renamed to
    <span class="code">activeIdentifiers</span> to improve code clarity.
</p>

<p>
    The status response has been updated to provide better information about the mesh connections. The
    number of inactive nodes, displayed previously, typically overstated the actual number of inactive nodes, as it
    displayed the difference between active nodes and unique identifiers on the mesh, which caused duplicate identifiers
    to be counted as inactive nodes. Rather than correcting the issue, the number of inactive nodes was removed
    entirely, and the number of active cycle identifiers was added, as this is a much more important value in
    determining the health of the mesh.
</p>

<p>
    The requester identifier has been added to the status response to aid in diagnosing why the public or privileged
    response was returned, and the number of node-join messages sent and the missing in-cycle verifiers have been added
    to show how the node-join modifications in this update are performing.
