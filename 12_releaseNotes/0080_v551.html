<h1>Nyzo release notes, version 551</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 551
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/9f92b85fe54929824aa070ff96f8ceaf01a95b86"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) corrects an issue with cycle transaction registration. It also contains
    several inconsequential changes to improve the quality of the codebase.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects primarily the verifier. It contains inconsequential changes that involve other run modes but
    do not affect their behavior significantly.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">CycleTransactionManager.registerTransaction()</span> method, two additional checks have
    been added before attempting to add a transaction to the map. The first, checking for an existing signature,
    prevents re-registration of a transaction already in the map. This is the most consequential change in this version,
    because such re-registration would cause signatures that had been collected for the existing transaction to be lost.
</p>

<p>
    The second check provides proper feedback when the new transaction has an earlier timestamp than the existing
    transaction. This does not change the behavior of the method &mdash; the merge method already chooses the
    transaction with the later timestamp &mdash; but it does communicate the results of the registration process better.

<p>
    In the <span class="code">registerSignature()</span> method, the return value of the
    <span class="code">Transaction.addSignature()</span> method is now considered before marking that the transaction
    has been registered and the map has changed. Note, when reading the
    <span class="code">Transaction.addSignature()</span> method, that a check is not performed to see if the transaction
    is already in the map. So, that method and this method will both return a value of <span class="code">true</span>
    for a signature that is otherwise valid, even if that signature has been registered previously.

<p>
    In <span class="code">MeshListener</span>, the underscore has been removed from several enumeration names. This is
    solely for consistency, and it is explained further below.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message</span>, similar enumeration name changes were also applied.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">MessageType</span> enumeration, the reason for the name changes is apparent. Prior to
    the introduction of "V2" messages, none of the enumeration names contained underscores. Underscores are generally
    uncommon in Java identifiers. In the V2 messages, underscores were necessary to separate the numerical message
    value. When the <span class="code">FrozenEdgeBalanceListRequest_45</span> message type was added, an underscore was
    used, following the pattern of the <span class="code">NodeJoinResponseV2_44</span> message type above it. However,
    the underscore was inconsistent with most values in this enumeration. Underscores continued to be used for new
    messages in this part of the list, through <span class="code">MinimalBlockResponse_52</span>. This issue was noted
    in a routine code review and corrected to reduce inconsistencies in the code base.

<p>
    Unused imports were removed from <span class="code">SeedTransactionManager</span>.

<p>
    To simplify testing of cycle transactions on a testnet, the <span class="code">TestnetGenesisBlockCreator</span> now
    generates the system's coins directly into the cycle account.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">addSignature()</span> method in the <span class="code">Transaction</span> class now returns
    a value indicating whether the signature was added to a transaction.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Verifier</span>, the process that retrieves and freezes the Genesis block now checks to
    ensure that the Genesis block is actually frozen.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">ClientTransactionUtil</span>, <span class="code">CycleTransactionListCommand</span>, and
    <span class="code">TransactionListResponse</span> also contain <span class="code">MessageType</span> enumeration
    value changes.

<p>
    In <span class="code">NyzoStringEncoder</span>, a case has been added for the new
    <span class="code">Signature</span> type, and the <span class="code">Micropay</span> case has been moved to order
    all cases alphabetically.
</p>

<p>
    The new <span class="code">NyzoStringSignature</span> class wraps a signature for use in a Nyzo string.
</p>

     alt="RN_551 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 280px;">

<p>
    The prefix <span class="code">sig_</span> is used for the new <span class="code">Signature</span> Nyzo string type.
</p>

     alt="RN_551 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 200px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Sentinel</span>, minor modifications have been implemented to ensure that the managed
    verifiers are properly loaded and accessible outside the typical sentinel initialization sequence.
</p>

     alt="RN_551 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">WebUtil</span>, a convenience method has been added for providing sender-data strings that are
    sanitized for use in HTML.

<p>
    In <span class="code">HtmlTag</span>, a check has been added to ensure <span class="code">null</span> entries are
    not added to the <span class="code">elements</span> list.
