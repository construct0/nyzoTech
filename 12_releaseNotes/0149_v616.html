<h1>Nyzo 616: client homepage</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 616
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/ecaa3049c72603c3e139e9c37bfc5c643d632036"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds a dynamic update of the frozen edge to the root client web view.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the client only.
</p>

<p>
    This is a small change that was made in the course of larger client updates. It is being released now to allow the
    next release to be more focused.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">ClientController</span>, a small script was added to the <span class="code">page()</span>
    method to update the frozen edge and client version using the <span class="code">/api/frozenEdge</span> endpoint.
    The value is updated every 7 seconds.

<p>
    To support the new homepage update, <span class="code">clientVersion</span> was added to the
    <span>FrozenEdgeCommand</span>.
