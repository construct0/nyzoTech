<h1>Nyzo 516: resynchronization improvements</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 516
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/377aece7f23be5ab0091bd89a71ebdef1cab11b6"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) further improves performance of the verifier and drastically reduces the
    time required to resynchronize with the blockchain after a verifier outage. In testing, a verifier shut down for
    100 blocks would consistently reinitialize and resynchronize within 60 seconds on a t3.small AWS instance.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the verifier only. The sentinel uses a different process to track the blockchain.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockVoteManager</span>, the vote maps have been changed to concurrent versions to improve
    thread safety. The <span class="code">numberOfVotesRequested</span> counter has been eliminated, and
    <span class="code">lastVoteRequestTimestamp</span> has been renamed to
    <span class="code">lastFrozenBlockRequestTimestamp</span> to reflect the new recovery process. Also,
    <span class="code">frozenBlockRequestHeight</span> has been added to support cycling through heights between
    iterations of the recovery process.
</p>

<p>
    Synchronization is not needed and has been removed from the <span class="code">votesForHeight()</span> method.
</p>

<p>
    The accessor method for <span class="code">numberOfVotesRequested</span> has also been removed, and the
    <span class="code">requestMissingVotes()</span> method has been renamed to
    <span class="code">requestMissingFrozenBlocks()</span> to more appropriately describe the new process.
</p>

<p>
    The basic logic that determines whether this verifier has fallen behind is unchanged. There is still a minimum
    interval between requests, and the 50% threshold still determines whether a request is made. However, where the
    previous logic was a simple yes/no decision about requesting information about the height just past the frozen edge,
    the new logic determines a maximum height to request.
</p>

<img src="images/0516/rn_516_3.png" alt="RN_516 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 490px;">

<p>
    The maximum height to request is one behind the maximum height for which 50% or more of the votes are available.
    The fallback has not been necessary for quite some time, as block votes are periodically rebroadcast if a block
    is not frozen.
</p>

<img src="images/0516/rn_516_4.png" alt="RN_516 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 447px;">

<p>
    Up to 10 blocks are requested in each iteration. If more than 10 are required, the
    <span class="code">frozenBlockRequestHeight</span> field is used to ensure the entire range is queried over
    multiple iterations. There is some room to reduce the overhead of this method by making a single request for a
    block range, but testing has revealed intermittent issues with such requests failing due to invalid signatures, and
    that issue has yet to be investigated and resolved.
</p>

<img src="images/0516/rn_516_5.png" alt="RN_516 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 497px;">

<p>
    Missing block votes are no longer requested. The messages remain in the system for compatibility with older
    verifiers, but they will be removed in a future version.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager</span>, the <span class="code">attemptToFreezeBlock()</span> method now
    returns a value indicating whether a block was frozen.
</p>

<img src="images/0516/rn_516_7.png" alt="RN_516 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 391px;">

<p>
    A new method, <span class="code">attemptToFreezeChain()</span>, has been added. This method will freeze an entire
    section of the blockchain between the frozen edge and the closest block for which the 75% voting threshold has been
    exceeded both for itself and for the next block in the chain. This method is the core of the new recovery process.
</p>

<img src="images/0516/rn_516_8.png" alt="RN_516 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 436px;">

<p>
    To support <span class="code">attemptToFreezeChain()</span>, the <span class="code">unverifiedBlockAtHeight()</span>
    method has been added. Some refactoring has been done to avoid code duplication.
</p>

<img src="images/0516/rn_516_9.png" alt="RN_516 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">Verifier</span> class, total wait time for bootstrap responses has been reduced from 20
    seconds to 5 seconds. Even with generous allowances for round-trip latency, 5 seconds is sufficient for all good
    responses to return and be processed. If one of the trusted entry points is not responsive at the time of
    initialization, this change will reduce initialization time by approximately 15 seconds.
</p>

<p>
    If a block cannot be frozen using the standard mechanism, the chain mechanism is now attempted. The return value was
    added to the standard-mechanism method to ensure that it is given first chance to operate, across multiple
    iterations, on an entire chain of waiting blocks with sufficient votes for freezing.
</p>

<img src="images/0516/rn_516_11.png" alt="RN_516 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 409px;">

<p>
    The updated method name for the revised recovery process is now used.
</p>

<img src="images/0516/rn_516_12.png" alt="RN_516 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 377px;">

<p>
    Visibility of <span class="code">requestBlockWithVotes()</span> has been reduced back to private, as this method
    is no longer used by <span class="code">BlockVoteManager</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0516/rn_516_13.png" alt="RN_516 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 379px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockWithVotesResponse</span>, blocks are now provided when available, even if votes for the
    block are no longer available. This was initially implemented to assist with the recovery process. While the
    recovery process no longer uses this message, the modifications were left in place because this is more reasonable
    than the previous behavior.
</p>

<img src="images/0516/rn_516_14.png" alt="RN_516 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 416px;">

<p>
    In the status response, the number of votes requested is no longer included. This was a significant source of
    traffic before <a href="v515">version 515</a>, but verifiers no longer attempt to get votes for older blocks in the
    recovery process.
