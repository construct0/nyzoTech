<h1>Nyzo 538: block consolidator options</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 538
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/c405250e7a85f596683c65329c35467a086cf8a3"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) implements the <span class="code">BlockFileConsolidator</span> options.
</p>


<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the verifier, sentinel, and Micropay server. They all use the
    <span class="code">BlockFileConsolidator</span>.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="emphasis">If you update to this version without making any changes to your preferences file, the
        behavior of the software will not change at all.</span> In order to take advantage of the changes in this
    version, you must make appropriate changes to your preferences file.
</p>


<p>
    When blocks are frozen, they are written to files to ensure that they are available on restart. To make these file
    writes as fast as possible, each block is initially written to its own file in the
    <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/blocks/individual</span> directory. These individual block files
    each contain both the balance list for the block and the actual block.
</p>

<p>
    While individual block files are convenient and efficient as the blockchain is being produced, they consume
    significant filesystem resources. To recover some of these resources, the
    <span class="code">BlockFileConsolidator</span> periodically bundles old blocks into files that typically contain
    1000 blocks and 1 balance list each. This typically reduces the number of files by 99.9%, and it has historically
    reduced storage space by more than 99%.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">BlockFileConsolidator</span>, though, does consume compute resources as it is running, and
    those resources have caused performance issues for the cycle in the past. <span class="emphasis">Based on our
    observations, we think that the <span class="code">BlockFileConsolidator</span> class was responsible for many of
    the verifier failures that ultimately resulted in the recent blockchain stall.</span>
</p>

<p>
    In a future version, the consolidation process will be improved to allow it to consume significantly lower
    compute resources than it does now while performing all the operations it currently performs. This version provides
    control over which parts of the consolidation process are performed. This will allow operators of verifiers to
    decide, based on their personal preferences and situations, how to best use the resources they have available to
    keep their verifiers as healthy as possible.
</p>

<p>
    All changes in this version are in <span class="code">BlockFileConsolidator</span>. The two separate options were
    replaced with a single combined option. The combination of active consolidation with disabled deletion would have
    been an efficiency issue without significant reworking of the process. A single option describing all valid
    behavior combinations is easier to understand and friendlier to use than a set of options for which certain
    combinations are invalid.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/preferences</span>, add the following line for delete-only
    operation. This is the least resource-intensive option.
</p>

<p class="command">
    block_file_consolidator=delete
</p>

<p>
    Or add the following line to disable the consolidator completely. This is only recommended for a verifier running on
    a server with a large filesystem.
</p>

<p class="command">
    block_file_consolidator=disable
</p>

<p>
    A <span class="code">main()</span> method has been added for starting the consolidator independently. This is useful
    for testing, and it is useful for those who choose to run the consolidator as a separate process, as the comment
    explains.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">start()</span> method, the <span class="code">disable</span> option value is used to
    bypass the consolidator thread entirely. Due to indentation changes, this change appears to be larger than it is.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">consolidateFiles()</span> method, consolidation is bypassed if the delete-only option is
    set.
</p>

<p>
    File deletion has been split into a separate method. Also, exclusion of the Genesis block from deletion has been
    changed slightly. The previous logic, which removed the Genesis block from the list, was not causing any errors, but
    it was bad programming practice. Mutating a list provided by another source to avoid processing an element of that
    list can cause bugs if the ordering of processing on that list is later changed.
