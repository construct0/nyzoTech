<h1>Nyzo 549: faster recovery</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 549
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/871720aee42b0143d84a5304a8a41a8502477a49"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds retrieval of blocks behind frozen edge to enable faster recovery
    for in-cycle verifiers. It also substantially reduces the network usage of out-of-cycle verifiers.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the verifier. It includes improvements for both in-cycle and out-of-cycle verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Block.fromByteBuffer()</span>, transaction validation has been eliminated for all blocks
    behind the frozen edge.
</p>

<p>
    In <span>Block.chainScore()</span>, a special case has been added for new verifiers to be allowed to send their
    blocks without having sufficient history to properly score blocks. As the comment explains, this score will often
    be incorrect, but the consequences of that incorrect score are acceptable and do not weaken the system.
</p>

<p>
    The visibility of the <span class="code">BlockManager.loadBalanceListFromFile()</span> method has been changed to
    <span class="code">public</span> to allow it to be accessed from the new
    <span class="code">HistoricalChainFiller</span> class.
</p>

<img src="images/0549/rn_549_2.png" alt="RN_549 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 430px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">ChainInitializationManager</span>, a maximum number of attempts has been added to the loop in
    the <span class="code">fetchBlock()</span> method. The <span class="code">initializeFrozenEdge()</span> method,
    which uses the <span class="code">fetchBlock()</span> method, was previously only used during the verifier
    initialization process. Now, the <span class="code">reinitializeFrozenEdge()</span> method of
    <span class="code">Verifier</span> also uses the <span class="code">initializeFrozenEdge()</span> method, executing
    it in a separate thread. The iteration limit ensures that these threads eventually complete.
</p>

<p>
    The logging statement in the <span class="code">initializeFrozenEdge()</span> method has been updated to be accurate
    in both the old and new uses of the method.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">ChainSectionRetriever</span> class, true to its name, encapsulates a process for retrieving
    a section of the blockchain. The start height, end height, and an "anchor hash" are specified. The anchor hash is
    the expected hash of the block at the end height.
</p>

<img src="images/0549/rn_549_4.png" alt="RN_549 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 420px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">ChainSectionRetriever</span> runs a sequential fetch process in a separate thread, working
    backward from the end height to the start height.
</p>

<img src="images/0549/rn_549_5.png" alt="RN_549 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">processFetchResponse()</span> method adds valid blocks from block responses to a map that is
    keyed on block height. This map is later used by the <span class="code">getBlocks()</span> method to produce a list
    of blocks ordered on block height.
</p>

<img src="images/0549/rn_549_6.png" alt="RN_549 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">HistoricalChainFiller</span> uses a combination of consolidated block files and block requests to
    fill the chain between the trailing edge and the frozen edge. Previously, a verifier with an incomplete chain
    history would wait for the chain to advance to a point where the any missing history was no longer relevant.
    However, this takes considerable time with longer verifier cycles. In-cycle verifiers are unable to properly
    produce or vote for blocks when they to not have a complete history between the trailing edge and the open edge,
    which prevents them from fully participating in the cycle.
</p>

<img src="images/0549/rn_549_7.png" alt="RN_549 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">HistoricalChainFiller</span> primarily relies on consolidated 1000-block files to provide
    blocks behind the frozen edge. For ranges of blocks not yet available in consolidated files, the new
    <span class="code">ChainSectionRetriever</span> is used.
</p>

<img src="images/0549/rn_549_8.png" alt="RN_549 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">requestFile()</span> method retrieves the newest consolidated file before the currently
    available blockchain history. Any gap between the available history and the end of this file is provided in the
    <span class="code">gapBlocks</span> list, which is fetched using a <span class="code">ChainSectionRetriever</span>
    instance. The blocks are verified and saved to local storage. The consolidated file is saved directly as fetched,
    and gap blocks are written to individual block files.
</p>

<p>
    Unrelated to the core changes of this version, the <span class="code">verifierChangeAllowed()</span> method has been
    removed from <span class="code">NodeManager</span>. This was initially intended to combat centralization, but the
    only effective way to address centralization is through improvement of the entrance process. This method was only
    causing confusion about verifier behavior and making debugging of node issues unnecessarily difficult.
</p>

<img src="images/0549/rn_549_10.png" alt="RN_549 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 490px;">

<p>
    Also unrelated to the core changes of this version, the <span class="code">SeedTransactionManager</span> class has
    been simplified. The <span class="code">lastBlockRequested</span> field has been replaced with references to
    <span class="code">BlockManager.getFrozenEdgeHeight()</span>, and raw <span class="code">Thread.sleep()</span>
    calls have been replaced with <span class="code">ThreadUtil.sleep()</span> calls to eliminate the verbosity of
    required exception handling.
</p>

<img src="images/0549/rn_549_11.png" alt="RN_549 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    The base URL for seed-transaction files has been changed from AWS S3 to Digital Ocean Spaces. These are equivalent
    services, but the Digital Ocean service is considerably less expensive.
</p>

<img src="images/0549/rn_549_12.png" alt="RN_549 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 420px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">Verifier</span> class has a new option to <span class="code">alwaysTrackBlockchain</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0549/rn_549_13.png" alt="RN_549 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    Please note that <span class="emphasis">the default behavior for out-of-cycle verifiers is different in this version
    than in the previous version</span>. The new default behavior of a loose tracking of the blockchain is preferable
    for typical out-of-cycle verifiers, but special use cases may require close tracking of the blockchain by
    out-of-cycle verifiers. To have an out-of-cycle verifier closely track the blockchain, add the following line to
    <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/preferences</span>:
</p>

<p class="command">
    always_track_blockchain=1
</p>

<p>
    To accommodate this new, looser tracking of the blockchain, a reinitialization process has been added to
    periodically jump the verifier's copy of the blockchain close to the cycle's frozen edge. For the top-voted
    out-of-cycle verifier, this process happens every 1 minute. For other out-of-cycle verifiers, the process happens
    every 20 minutes.
</p>

<img src="images/0549/rn_549_14.png" alt="RN_549 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 450px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">backfillInterval</span> and associated timestamp control how frequently the verifier attempts
    to complete missing chain history.
</p>

<img src="images/0549/rn_549_15.png" alt="RN_549 code 15" class="code-image" style="width: 380px;">

<p>
    In the main verifier loop, the top new verifier now shares the in-cycle condition that requests missing frozen and
    unfrozen blocks. Additionally, the top new verifier reinitializes the frozen edge in this condition and requests a
    block with votes. While this is a rather aggressive set of actions, such aggression is warranted. This verifier has
    suddenly gone from lazily tracking the blockchain to tightly tracking the frozen edge in order to produce a block to
    join the cycle.
</p>

<img src="images/0549/rn_549_16.png" alt="RN_549 code 16" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    When instructed to do so, out-of-cycle verifiers will closely track the frozen edge of the blockchain, even if they
    have no immediate opportunity to join the cycle.
</p>

<img src="images/0549/rn_549_17.png" alt="RN_549 code 17" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    If close tracking is not specified, out-of-cycle verifiers will loosely track the frozen edge of the blockchain,
    reinitializing every 20 minutes to maintain knowledge of which verifiers are in the cycle.
</p>

<img src="images/0549/rn_549_18.png" alt="RN_549 code 18" class="code-image" style="width: 500px;">

<p>
    A periodic call to <span class="code">HistoricalChainFiller</span> has been added for times when the verifier has
    not yet established the blockchain trailing edge. If the trailing edge is unknown, blocks cannot be properly scored.
</p>

<img src="images/0549/rn_549_19.png" alt="RN_549 code 19" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    Update of the top-voted verifier has been moved from the section of code that is executed when a block is frozen to
    the section of code that is executed on a regular interval roughly equal to the standard block duration. This
    ensures that out-of-cycle verifiers regularly update their top-voted verifier even if they are not regularly
    freezing blocks. Also, each time a set of individual block votes is requested, a block-with-votes request is also
    issued. This request serves the same basic function as the individual requests, but it allows blocks to be frozen
    much more quickly.
</p>

<img src="images/0549/rn_549_20.png" alt="RN_549 code 20" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    The top new verifier is now allowed to create new blocks even if the continuity state of the previous block cannot
    be determined. This allows new verifiers to create blocks immediately after they have reinitialized their frozen
    edges.
</p>

<img src="images/0549/rn_549_21.png" alt="RN_549 code 21" class="code-image" style="width: 520px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">isTopNewVerifier()</span> method is shorthand for checking if
    <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteManager</span> has chosen the local verifier as the top verifier. The
    <span class="code">reinitializeFrozenEdge()</span> method spawns a thread to execute the
    <span class="code">ChainInitializationManager.initializeFrozenEdge()</span> method.
</p>

<img src="images/0549/rn_549_22.png" alt="RN_549 code 22" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">PreferencesUtil</span>, an overload of the <span class="code">get()</span> method, which is
    used to retrieve <span class="code">String</span> values, has been added. This overload allows specification of a
    default value, and it is used for the <span class="code">consolidated_block_base_url</span> preference in
    <span class="code">HistoricalChainFiller</span>.
