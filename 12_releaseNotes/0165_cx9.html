<h1>Nyzo Chrome 9: rapid automatic tx</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo Chrome extension version 9
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/chromeExtension/commit/f0903b45acfdc5c845d99a7f6b93e546181d53d5"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds a mutex to ensure that the automatic authorization is properly
    applied and decremented when automatic transactions are submitted rapidly.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code-mb">Byte<wbr>Buffer</span> class, scoping of several variables was improved.

<p>
    In the <span class="code-mb">Byte<wbr>Buffer.<wbr>read<wbr>Integer<wbr>Value()</span> method, scoping was improved,
    the calculation of the result was corrected, and a missing <span class="code-mb">return</span> statement was added.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code-mb">send<wbr>Transaction()</span> function of the <span class="code-mb">content</span>
    script, a mutex is now used to protect retrieving and setting of automatic authorization values. The mutex is
    acquired in the <span class="code-mb">send<wbr>Transaction()</span> function, and the logic previously in this
    function was moved to the new <span class="code-mb">send<wbr>Transaction<wbr>Target()</span> function.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code-mb">send<wbr>Transaction<wbr>Target()</span> function, the mutex is released after the
    authorization is updated when an automatic transaction is about to be sent.
</p>

<p>
    When a transaction fails, error details are now included in the <span class="code-mb">nyzo-transaction-failed</span>
    event to allow the page to communicate the cause of the error to the user.
</p>

<p>
    When a transaction is not sent due to an issue identified by this script, the mutex is released without updating the
    authorization value. An error is also included in the <span class="code-mb">nyzo-transaction-failed</span> event
    sent from this logic branch.

<p>
    In the <span class="code-mb">decode()</span> function of the <span class="code-mb">nyzo<wbr>String</span> script,
    whitespace now is trimmed from the input string to avoid decoding issues that this whitespace would cause.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code-mb">options</span> script, whitespace is now trimmed from the private key value before
    storage.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code-mb">Transaction</span> constructor, the type is now explicitly specified as
    <span class="code">2</span>, which is a standard transaction. This was implicit in previous versions. Variable
    scoping was updated for two iterators, and the <span class="code-mb">set<wbr>Sender<wbr>Identifier()</span> method
    was added.
</p>

<p>
    Later in the <span class="code-mb">Transaction</span> class, scoping was updated for the iterator in the
    <span class="code-mb">set<wbr>Sender<wbr>Data()</span> method. The <span class="code-mb">set<wbr>Signature()</span>
    method was added.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code-mb">Transaction.from<wbr>Bytes()</span> method, several errors were corrected.
