<h1>Nyzo 531: eliminate block blacklisting</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 531
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/fc51f4fb37fc78a2c715c5b42f501cab5dac63c5"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) eliminates blacklisting for blocks received from unexpected verifiers.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version only involves code running on the verifier. Though the changes affect how sentinels are treated,
    updating a sentinel to this version will not have any effect.
</p>

<p>
    This change involves a single line of logic. In <span class="code">Message</span>, a condition has been added to
    avoid blacklisting for new-block messages.

<p>
    This change is necessary to allow the sentinel to broadcast blocks for new verifiers. This will help to avoid
    manipulation of the entry process with denial-of-service attacks. While sentinels can calculate which verifier
    should be voted into the cycle next, they are unable to know with certainty when the new-verifier votes have been
    cast throughout the cycle. This change reduces the possibility of a sentinel being temporarily blacklisted due to a
    timing issue in block transmission.
</p>

<p>
    In a later version, changes will be made to the sentinel to allow it to broadcast blocks for new verifiers in
    appropriate circumstances. That change will be released after a sufficient proportion of the cycle has updated to
    version 531 or later.
</p>

<p>
    When the version adding sentinel support for new-verifier blocks is released, multiple bounties will be awarded for
    the reports that led to these changes.
