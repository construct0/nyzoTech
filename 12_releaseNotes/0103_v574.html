<h1>Nyzo 574: trusted-message verification</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 574
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/b72063fdd1d15bdccaf6e4ebb2ee9094be40dae6"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds trusted-message verification to the sentinel.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the sentinel. If you are updating your sentinel, please check operation after the update.
    Incorrectly configured sentinels may no longer work after the update due to new protections, even if they previously
    worked properly.
</p>

<p>
    The changes in this version are due to a bug that was reported by a member of the community. These notes will be
    amended later with an address for receiving any bounty that the cycle chooses to award. As was noted in the release
    notes of version 572, we feel that delaying bounty transactions until the deployment of
    <a href="/teamTechnologyProposals/nttp3">NTTP-3</a> is warranted.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Block</span>, spaces were added to the <span class="code">toString()</span> method. This
    allows for better line-wrapping behavior in the <span class="code">Last block transmitted</span> field of the
    sentinel web UI. The display will not update immediately when the sentinel is restarted running this version, but it
    will update the next time the sentinel sends a block to the cycle to protect a verifier.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">ManagedVerifier</span>, the <span class="code">responseIdentifier</span> field was added. This
    is used to store the identifier that is being used to sign response messages from the verifier.
</p>

<img src="images/0574/rn_574_1.png" alt="RN_574 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 270px; max-height: 240px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Sentinel.updateMesh()</span>, the mesh request is now signed by the key of the
    <span class="code">ManagedVerifier</span>, not the default system key. If the seeds are correctly specified, this
    means that all requests coming from sentinels will be self-signed from the verifier's perspective. This does not yet
    alter any behavior, but it poses no additional computational burden and might be useful for the verifier in a future
    version.
</p>

<img src="images/0574/rn_574_2.png" alt="RN_574 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 170px;">

<p>
    When the mesh response is received, the <span class="code">sourceNodeIdentifier</span> of the message is stored as
    the <span class="code">responseIdentifier</span> of the <span class="code">ManagedVerifier</span>. The type of the
    content is also checked to avoid a <span class="code">ClassCastException</span>, but this is a minor cleanup, not a
    consequential change.
</p>

<p>
    The comparison of the verifier's identifier to the source-node identifier of the response is consequential.
    Previously, responses from all identifiers were accepted. Now, if the seed of a
    <span class="code">ManagedVerifier</span> is incorrect, it will no longer work as a trusted data source. This change
    was made to combat man-in-the-middle attacks that would seek to derail a sentinel's tracking of the blockchain by
    providing incorrect information.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Sentinel.updateBlocks()</span>, the block request is now signed by the key of the
    <span class="code">ManagedVerifier</span>. This, like the updated signing of the mesh request, does not yet alter
    any behavior.
</p>

<img src="images/0574/rn_574_4.png" alt="RN_574 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    When the <span class="code">BlockResponse</span> is received, it is checked for content type and source-node
    identifier, just as the <span class="code">MeshResponse</span> above. If the source-node identifier does not match
    the identifier specified for the <span class="code">ManagedVerifier</span>, the block is rejected.
</p>

<img src="images/0574/rn_574_5.png" alt="RN_574 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 260px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Sentinel.transmitBlockIfNecessary()</span>, the new-block message is now built with the
    <span class="code">Message</span> constructor that accepts a seed instead of using the default verifier seed. This
    constructor of <span class="code">Message</span> was not available when the sentinel was implemented. This is a
    minor improvement that eliminates an unnecessary re-signing of the message.
</p>

<img src="images/0574/rn_574_6.png" alt="RN_574 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">SentinelController</span>, a section is now added to display all managed verifiers that are
    configured with incorrect seeds.
</p>

<img src="images/0574/rn_574_7.png" alt="RN_574 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    CSS was added to give the verifier name label an orange background if the verifier does not appear to have the
    correct identifier. Notices about incorrect identifiers are placed below the table in orange italic text.
</p>

<img src="images/0574/rn_574_8.png" alt="RN_574 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 130px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">verifier-label-incorrect-identifier</span> class takes precedence over the
    <span class="code">verifier-label-active</span> class, which is darkens labels to indicate which verifiers were
    queried in the last time slot.
</p>

<img src="images/0574/rn_574_9.png" alt="RN_574 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">SentinelController.incorrectVerifierNotices()</span> renders messages to be placed below the
    table. These messages indicate which verifiers are not responding with the correct identifier, and they display both
    the correct identifier and the actual response identifier.
</p>

<img src="images/0574/rn_574_10.png" alt="RN_574 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 150px;">

<p>
    In the web interface, incorrect response identifiers are obvious. Blocks are rejected, which turns all block tiles
    red, and the verifier name displays in orange. For any mismatches, the specified identifier and actual identifier of
    the verifier of any mismatches are displayed below the table.
