<h1>Nyzo 586: initialization improvements &amp; URL updates</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 586
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/18e39b62870c381113c5088db9c2ad073aec2463"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) provides significant improvements to the initialization process for
    <span class="code">BlockManager</span>. It also updates URLs for seed transactions and consolidated block files.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects all run modes that use the <span class="code">BlockManager</span>,
    <span class="code">SeedTransactionManager</span>, or <span class="code">HistoricalChainFiller</span>.
</p>

<p>
    This version is in response to two problems. First, the growth in balance list sizes is revealing an inefficiency
    in the block loading process. Second, excessive bandwidth usage is causing us to accrue excessive expenses, and we
    need to bring those expenses under control.
</p>

<p class="italic">
    Please update to this version soon. We are currently paying for over 14 TB of bandwidth per day, and this is
    exceptionally expensive. This is also more than 300 times the bandwidth that the system should be using with the
    current cycle and queue sizes. While we are willing to continue hosting files to benefit the community, we need to
    be able to control bandwidth usage. The URL changes in this version will allow us to blacklist abusive downloaders
    to reserve bandwidth for legitimate sources. We will deactivate the old URLs as soon as possible to try to control
    costs. If you have not updated to this version by that time, your verifier and sentinel will no longer be able to
    download seed transaction and consolidated block files. The consolidated block files allow for faster recovery, and
    the seed transactions are necessary for generating transaction fees. <span class="emphasis">If you do not update
    before we deactivate the old URLs, your verifier earnings will be reduced.</span>
</p>

<p>
    Of course, anyone is welcome to host their own seed transaction and consolidated block files, and we encourage the
    community to set up alternate download sources. Setting up a source of either of these is easy, and it will increase
    the decentralization of the system. Both URLs are now specified as preferences, so alternate URLs can be used
    without modifying the source code.

    In <span class="code">Block</span>, the <span class="code">fromFile()</span> method was added for reading blocks
    directly from files. This method parallels the <span class="code">fromByteBuffer()</span> method.

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager</span>, the <span class="code">loadBlockFromIndividualFile()</span> method was
    added as an optimized method for loading only a <span class="code">Block</span> object from an individual file.
    Importantly, this method bypasses loading the entire block file, which includes a
    <span class="code">BalanceList</span>, into memory. In testing, total verifier initialization time was reduced by
    more than 85% on our verifiers after implementing this method.

<p>
    The <span class="code">BlockManager.loadBlockFromFile()</span> method now uses the new
    <span class="code">loadBlockFromIndividualFile()</span> method.

<p>
    In <span class="code">HistoricalChainFiller</span>, the Digital Ocean default base URL has been replaced with the
    new <span class="code">blocks.nyzo.co</span> URL.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message</span>, an overload of <span class="code">getByteArray()</span> has been added to
    facilitate deserialization of Nyzo objects from files.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">SeedTransactionManager</span>, the hard-coded base URL has been replaced with a value
    retrieved from preferences. The default value for this is the new <span class="code">seed.nyzo.co</span> data
    source.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">ShortLong</span>, the new <span class="code">fromFile()</span> method parallels the
    <span class="code">fromByteBuffer()</span> method.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Transaction</span>, the new <span class="code">fromFile()</span> method parallels the
    <span class="code">fromByteBuffer()</span> method. We are looking now at reducing code duplication by reusing the
    <span class="code">fromByteBuffer()</span> methods to eliminate the need for the parallel
    <span class="code">fromFile()</span> methods. If we are successful, this will likely involve a custom subclass of
    <span class="code">ByteBuffer</span> that reads values from an instance of
    <span class="code">RandomAccessFile</span> on demand.
