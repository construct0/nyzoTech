<h1>Nyzo 581: relay server</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 581
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/832d8f0af2d450cc6f79b90e6c8ba761b15c5780"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds the relay server.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version introduces a new run mode, the relay server. Also, it makes some small changes that affect AJAX
    updates.
</p>

<p>
    The relay server is not a necessary component for most users working with Nyzo. It is, however, a part of our
    current web infrastructure, and the code developed for it will be used in other run modes. We are still working
    toward making all of our infrastructure open source, and this is being released publicly to move toward that goal.
</p>

<p>
    The relay server is a simple proxy server for delivering web content. It is currently running on
    <span class="code">relay0.nyzo.co</span> and <span class="code">relay1.nyzo.co</span>. While other software would
    have been suitable for these servers, running a common codebase on all of our servers improves efficiency of
    deployment and allows us to test the codebase in more settings to improve resiliency.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="filename">nyzoMicropayServer.conf</span> file was removed. The scripts should now be used for
    generating configuration files.
</p>

<img src="images/0581/rn_581_0.png" alt="RN_581 code 0" class="code-image" style="width: 490px; max-height: 140px;">

<p>
    The <span class="filename">nyzoRelayServer.sh</span> script was added for generating the configuration file for the
    new run mode.
</p>

<img src="images/0581/rn_581_1.png" alt="RN_581 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 180px;">

<p>
    The <span class="filename">nyzoSentinel.conf</span> file was removed. The scripts should now be used for
    generating configuration files.
</p>

<img src="images/0581/rn_581_2.png" alt="RN_581 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 470px; max-height: 140px;">

<p>
    The <span class="filename">nyzoVerifier.conf</span> file was removed.
</p>

<img src="images/0581/rn_581_3.png" alt="RN_581 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 370px; max-height: 140px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">RelayServer</span> value was added to the <span class="code">RunMode</span> enumeration.
</p>

<img src="images/0581/rn_581_4.png" alt="RN_581 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 220px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    The new <span class="code">RelayController</span> class builds the endpoints for the relay server. The endpoints are
    specified in the <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/relay_endpoints</span> file. This is a
    comma-delimited file. The octothorpe (#) is the comment delimiter. The first element of each line is the source
    endpoint or file, the second element is the destination endpoint, and the third is the refresh interval in
    milliseconds.
</p>

<p>
    So, to have the relay server echo the contents of https://nyzo.co/cycleInfo to an endpoint of /info, refreshing
    every 5 seconds, the following line would be placed in the configuration file.
</p>

<p class="command">
    https://nyzo.co/cycleInfo,/info,5000
</p>

<p>
    To have the contents of <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/web/index.html</span> mapped to the root
    endpoint, refreshing every minute, the following line would be placed in the configuration file.
</p>

<p class="command">
    file://var/lib/nyzo/production/web/index.html,/,60000
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">RelayEndpoint</span> class implements <span class="code">EndpointResponseProvider</span>.
    This class fetches data and produces responses for all endpoints on the relay server. The
    <span class="code">refresh()</span> method either reads a file or retrieves the contents of a URL, and it produces
    an <span class="code">EndpointResponse</span> with the data it collects. The <span class="code">Last-Modified</span>
    header is set to indicate the age of the content, and the <span class="code">Access-Control-Allow-Origin</span>
    header is set to <span class="code">*</span> to allow cross-site scripting.
</p>

<img src="images/0581/rn_581_6.png" alt="RN_581 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 490px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">RelayEndpointManager</span> class manages the refresh of registered
    <span class="code">RelayEndpoint</span> objects.
</p>

<img src="images/0581/rn_581_7.png" alt="RN_581 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 390px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">RelayServer</span> class is the entry point for the relay-server run mode. The class sets the
    run mode and starts the web listener.
</p>

<img src="images/0581/rn_581_8.png" alt="RN_581 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 250px; max-height: 160px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">EndpointResponse</span> class, the <span class="code">contentTypeForFile()</span> method
    was added to automatically determine content types for common file types. Similar logic is implemented separately
    for both the documentation server and Micropay server. In a future version, some refactoring will be performed to
    reduce undesirable redundancy in the codebase.
</p>

<img src="images/0581/rn_581_9.png" alt="RN_581 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 370px; max-height: 290px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">WebListener</span>, an preference was added for the connection timeout. The default is the
    previous value of 2.0 seconds.
</p>

<p>
    The web listener is always started for the relay server, and the <span class="code">RelayController</span> provides
    the endpoint map.
</p>

<img src="images/0581/rn_581_10.png" alt="RN_581 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 400px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">WebUtil</span>, a method was added for providing dates in IMF-fixdate format. This is the
    preferred date/time format for HTTP/1.1, as specified in
    <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.1" target="_blank">RFC 7231, section 7.1.1.1</a>. This
    method is used by <span class="code">RelayEndpoint</span> for the <span class="code">Last-Modified</span> header.
</p>

<img src="images/0581/rn_581_11.png" alt="RN_581 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 370px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">HtmlTag</span>, the <span class="code">ajaxUpdate()</span> method parameters were reworked to
    add flexibility. A new overload was added as a passthrough with the same signature and ultimate behavior as the old
    method.
</p>

<img src="images/0581/rn_581_12.png" alt="RN_581 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 140px;">

<p>
    In the generated JavaScript of <span class="code">HtmlTag.ajaxUpdate()</span>, the separate
    <span class="code">refreshInterval</span> and <span class="code">staleInterval</span> are now used. An array of
    endpoints is now used, though the behavior is unchanged if only a single endpoint is present in the array. The
    <span class="code">contentTimestamp</span> is used to store the timestamp represented by the
    <span class="code">Last-Modified</span> header of responses.
</p>

<img src="images/0581/rn_581_13.png" alt="RN_581 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 190px;">

<p>
    The refresh now uses <span class="code">setTimeout()</span> instead of <span class="code">setInterval()</span> to
    provide better spacing of requests, and the endpoints are queried in a circular queue. Use of the
    <span class="code">Last-Modified</span> value, if present, ensures that a later update with older source content
    does not take precedence over newer source content.
</p>

<img src="images/0581/rn_581_14.png" alt="RN_581 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 330px;">

<p>
    A helper JavaScript function was added to get the timestamp from the <span class="code">Last-Modified</span> header.
    There is now an <span class="code">immediateRefresh</span> option that triggers the refresh a single time without
    delay.
</p>

<img src="images/0581/rn_581_15.png" alt="RN_581 code 15" class="code-image" style="width: 350px; max-height: 210px;">

<p>
    The separate <span class="code">staleInterval</span> is now used to allow a varying relationship between refresh
    rate and the amount of time that must elapse before an element's opacity changes to indicate that it is no longer
    current. This function, which is inexpensive computationally and produces no network traffic, is now executed at a
    higher rate relative to the interval.
</p>
