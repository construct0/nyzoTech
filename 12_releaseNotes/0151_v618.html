<h1>Nyzo 618: client transaction indexing</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 618
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/0c8ffe0074166cb9fedb91f020b22cf65da14487"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds transaction indexing for the client.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version does not affect any run modes. The functionality implemented will be used by the client in a future
    version.
</p>

<p>
    When using the Nyzo blockchain for general data storage, the ability to index and efficiently search for
    transactions is necessary. This version adds simple transaction indexing and retrieval. In a future version, this
    functionality will be activated and wired into the client's transaction-search command. The Nyzo Chrome extension
    will then be able to use the API version of this command to efficiently retrieve, among other data, game states.
</p>

<p>
    So, this version is just a step to playing Falken's Maze (well, actually, tic-tac-toe first) on Nyzo.

</div>

<p style="margin-top: 0;">
    The <span class="code">TransactionIndexer</span> class implements indexing. A preference is provided to allow
    indexing to be disabled. A subdirectory of the Nyzo data root directory stores the index files. Constants are
    defined for the byte size of an index entry and the maximum number of transactions that will be returned in a single
    query.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">TransactionIndexer.indexTransactionsForBlock()</span> method implements indexing at the top
    level. All standard transactions in a block are indexed for both the sender and receiver. The transactions are first
    written to a file containing a list of all transactions sent or received by an account. Then, an index entry is
    written referencing the list entry. The ordering of these writes is important. Each file is written in a manner that
    is effectively atomic, and writing the list entry first ensures that no index entries reference missing list
    entries, regardless of when the process might be interrupted.
</p>

<img src="images/0618/rn_618_1.png" alt="RN_618 image 1" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 270px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">TransactionIndexer.transactionsForAccount()</span> method implements retrieval. Currently,
    this method returns only the newest transactions in an account, up to the limit of 100. Transaction selection is
    performed on the index file. Then, the transactions are retrieved from the list file using the offsets provided by
    the index file. This method will evolve to provide paging, searching on timestamp and block ranges, and filtering on
    sender-data prefixes.
</p>

<p>
    Exceptions are logged, and the shorthand <span class="code">safeClose()</span> method is used to ensure that the
    files are properly closed.
</p>

<img src="images/0618/rn_618_3.png" alt="RN_618 image 3" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">TransactionIndexer.writeTransactionToList()</span> method appends the bytes of a
    <span class="code">Transaction</span> object to the end of the specified list file.
</p>

<img src="images/0618/rn_618_4.png" alt="RN_618 image 4" class="code-image" style="width: 310px; max-height: 180px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">TransactionIndexer.writeTransactionToIndex()</span> method is slightly more complex. To keep
    the index entries in order on ascending timestamp without requiring indexing to be performed in order, the index
    file is rewritten to a temporary file, inserting the index entry at the appropriate point. This conserves memory,
    because it reads and writes only a single entry at a time.
</p>

<img src="images/0618/rn_618_5.png" alt="RN_618 image 5" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 440px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">safeClose()</span> method is used to ensure that the files are properly closed, and the
    temporary file is moved atomically to replace the previous index file. This ensures that the worst case of an
    abruptly terminated indexing operation would be a single orphan entry in the transaction list file, and there are no
    situations that would result in a corrupt index file.
</p>

<p>
    Exceptions are logged, and a special case is provided for the first index entry in the file.
</p>

<img src="images/0618/rn_618_6.png" alt="RN_618 image 6" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 290px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">TransactionIndexer.listFileForAccount()</span> and
    <span class="code">TransactionIndexer.indexFileForAccount()</span> methods provide consistent paths for their
    respective files.
</p>

<img src="images/0618/rn_618_7.png" alt="RN_618 image 7" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">TransactionIndexer.transactionIndexEntry()</span> method serializes some data useful for
    transaction lookup into a fixed-width entry. The fixed-width entry, combined with ordering on timestamp, will allow
    easy binary searches to find start and end indices for searches limited on timestamp or block-height ranges.
</p>

<img src="images/0618/rn_618_8.png" alt="RN_618 image 8" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 200px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">TransactionIndexer.safeClose()</span> method is used to improve readability of other methods.
</p>

<img src="images/0618/rn_618_9.png" alt="RN_618 image 9" class="code-image" style="width: 230px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">TransactionIndexerTest</span> was added to the test suite. We now ensure these tests complete
    successfully before each code release, and we are working to improve test coverage.
</p>

<img src="images/0618/rn_618_10.png" alt="RN_618 image 10" class="code-image" style="width: 210px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    The remainder of additions in this version are in <span class="code">TransactionIndexerTest</span>. This is a
    typical implementation of the <span class="code">NyzoTest</span> interface. A <span class="code">main()</span>
    method allows this test class to be run individually.
</p>
<img src="images/0618/rn_618_11.png" alt="RN_618 image 11" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 310px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">TransactionIndexerTest.run()</span> method is the top level of the test. Java reflection is
    used to get the paths of some files used internally by <span class="code">TransactionIndexer</span>. The files are
    deleted to make the test idempotent.
</p>

<img src="images/0618/rn_618_12.png" alt="RN_618 image 12" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 260px;">

<p>
    A set of test transactions is created and indexed. The content of the list files for the accounts is checked. The
    content of the index files is checked. Finally, the transaction lookup is checked.
</p>

<img src="images/0618/rn_618_13.png" alt="RN_618 image 13" class="code-image" style="width: 370px; max-height: 330px;">

<p>
    A small set of absurd transactions is created. These are wrapped in a block and indexed. Note just how ridiculous
    the values in the transactions are. If any validation logic were applied, the transactions would all be removed
    before indexing. When logic is able to handle unreasonable values, however, testing such unreasonable values can be
    useful for better understanding the logic's behavior in extreme cases.
</p>

<img src="images/0618/rn_618_14.png" alt="RN_618 image 14" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 260px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">TransactionIndexerTest.checkIndexFile()</span> method sorts the input transactions to ensure
    proper ordering in the index file. The timestamp and amount are checked.
</p>

<img src="images/0618/rn_618_15.png" alt="RN_618 image 15" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 330px;">

<p>
    The sender data is checked, and the sender byte (sender/receiver) is checked. The file offset is not yet checked.
    Any exception also results in test failure.
</p>

<img src="images/0618/rn_618_16.png" alt="RN_618 image 16" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 280px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">TransactionIndexerTest.checkListFile()</span>, the bytes of all transactions are checked in
    the order they were added.
</p>

<img src="images/0618/rn_618_17.png" alt="RN_618 image 17" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 280px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">TransactionIndexerTest.checkTransactionLookup()</span> method retrieves transactions using
    the public <span class="code">TransactionIndexer.transactionsForAccount()</span> method. The size of the retrieved
    set is checked.
</p>

<img src="images/0618/rn_618_18.png" alt="RN_618 image 18" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 220px;">

<p>
    The type (2: standard transaction) is checked. The timestamp, amount, and sender identifier are checked.
</p>

<img src="images/0618/rn_618_19.png" alt="RN_618 image 19" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 360px;">

<p>
    The receiver identifier and previous-hash height are checked. The previous-block hash of the input and output
    transactions are checked separately, and this field is not expected to be the same on output as on input.
</p>

<img src="images/0618/rn_618_20.png" alt="RN_618 image 20" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 340px;">

<p>
    The sender data and signature are checked.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">getFailureCause()</span> method is implemented as required by the
    <span class="code">NyzoTest</span> interface.
</p>
