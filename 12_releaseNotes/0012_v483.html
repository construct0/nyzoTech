<h1>Nyzo 483: memory reporting</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 483
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/3ba0da06f24a16ee3fed42daf071e6778b2d9e7f"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) improves memory usage reporting for the verifier.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version does not alter behavior of the verifier or the sentinel. It is for verifier monitoring purposes only.
</p>

<p>
    In <a href="v481">version 481</a>, memory usage was added to the status response. However, the value returned was
    calculated the moment the status response was generated. Such a value is useful, but a sampling of memory usage at
    many different times gives more insight into the overall performance of the verifier.
</p>

<p>
    A new class, <span class="code">MemoryMonitor</span>, was added in this update. The class starts a thread that
    checks memory usage at a 3-second interval. This is frequent enough to get a reasonable picture of overall memory
    usage but infrequent enough that its computational burden is negligible. The class stores the minimum, maximum, and
    sum memory usage. The sum is later used to calculate average usage.

<p>
    In the <span class="code">StatusResponse</span> class, the previous memory line has been replaced with the
    information provided by the <span class="code">MemoryMonitor</span> class.

<p>
    The memory values are provided in mebibytes (MiB). A small protection is provided to avoid division by zero when
    the iterations value is zero.

<p>
    The monitoring thread is started in a <span class="code">static</span> block in the
    <span class="code">MemoryMonitor</span> class. So, the thread will be automatically started when the class is
    loaded. Oracle has a
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/initial.html" target="_blank">page with a good
        explanation of how static initializers work.</a>
