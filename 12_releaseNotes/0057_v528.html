<h1>Nyzo 528: initialization bug fixes</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 528
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/f033520efd1611787f9e1327296564d6c969b7ba"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) corrects an issue with the block-freezing process, and it also corrects
    a separate sentinel initialization issue.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the verifier, sentinel, and client.
</p>

<p>
    Recent performance improvements in the balance-list manager caused two different initialization issues. One of these
    issues potentially affected all three run modes. The other issue only affected new sentinels or sentinels that had
    been offline for more than 4 cycles.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">BalanceListManager.updateFrozenEdge()</span> was modified to accept the frozen-edge list as an
    argument. This method is only called from two places in <span class="code">BlockManager</span>. Previously, the
    frozen-edge balance list was registered just before this method was called. Then, this method would retrieve the
    frozen-edge list by getting the frozen-edge block and the calling <span class="code">balanceListForBlock()</span>.
    In some cases, however, <span class="code">balanceListForBlock()</span> would return <span class="code">null</span>,
    even though a balance list for the appropriate height had just been registered.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">balanceListForBlock()</span> method needs to be re-examined and further refined, as its
    failure was the root cause of this problem. However, any changes made to that method will have further-reaching
    effects in the code than this change and will need to be considered more carefully and tested more thoroughly. This
    change is simple: we know what balance list the <span class="code">updateFrozenEdge()</span> method needs, and we
    know that it is unable to obtain that balance list in some instances. We are now passing the balance list directly
    into the method instead of using a registration/lookup process that is more complicated and known to sometimes fail.

<p>
    In the two places where <span class="code">BalanceListManager.updateFrozenEdge()</span> is called, both in
    <span class="code">BlockManager</span>, the frozen-edge list is now provided as an argument. The call to
    <span class="code">BalanceListManager.registerBalanceList()</span> has been eliminated in both cases, as the
    balance-list map is cleared and rebuilt in the <span class="code">updateFrozenEdge()</span> method.
</p>

<p>
    The other correction is in the <span class="code">Sentinel</span> class. Balance lists near the retention edge can
    no longer be fetched from verifiers. The sentinel now starts working from the frozen edge if it needs a balance
    list.
</p>

<p>
    The unavailability of balance lists near the retention edge results in a significantly longer time that a new
    sentinel must wait before it can protect its verifiers. Before, the sentinel had to fetch 4 cycles of blocks
    before it could protect verifiers. Now, it must wait for 4 cycles of blocks to be created. At the current cycle
    size of 1181, this takes just over 9 hours. In future versions, a method for fetching historical blockchain data
    will be added, and this 9-hour wait should be reduced to just a few minutes.
