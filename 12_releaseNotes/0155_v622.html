<h1>Nyzo 622: consolidated block directories</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 622
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/df806037e8e2c5eaa3793b3377c3548f00601a82"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) corrects an issue with directory creation in the
    <span class="code">BlockFileConsolidator</span>.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the three run modes that use the consolidator: the verifier, the sentinel, and the client.
</p>

<p>
    This is a small update that is both important and deliberately inconsequential for most users.
</p>

<p>
    In <a href="v588#:~:text=The%20file%20is%20written%20to" target="_blank">version 588</a>, the
    <span class="code">BlockManager.writeBlocksToFile()</span> method was rewritten for efficiency. In this rewrite, a
    call to <span class="code">mkdirs()</span> on the parent file was removed (line 220 in the before-commit code). This
    was not a problem for the individual block files, because creation of the directory for these files is ensured in
    <span class="code">BlockManager.initialize()</span>. However, this <span class="italic">was</span> a problem for
    consolidated files.
</p>

<p>
    This version corrects the issue of directory creation for consolidated block files. This version also modifies and
    clarifies the behavior of the <span class="code">BlockFileConsolidator</span> to ensure the corrected behavior does
    not cause issues for verifiers or sentinels.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockFileConsolidator</span>, a value for the <span class="code">consolidate</span> run option
    was added. This was an implicit, default behavior before.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockFileConsolidator.start()</span>, the run option is checked. If one of the enumeration
    values is not specified, the default is applied. For the verifier and sentinel, the default is
    <span class="code">delete</span>. For the client, the default is <span class="code">consolidate</span>.
</p>

<p>
    This is a change in specified behavior for both the verifier and sentinel. However, consolidated block files are
    mostly useless for both the verifier and sentinel, and this is not a change in actual behavior for most verifiers
    and sentinels. Furthermore, if verifiers and sentinels did suddenly begin storing consolidated block files after an
    extended period of not storing these files, this change in behavior could cause disk-space issues on instances that
    were not concerned about such issues before.

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockFileConsolidator.consolidateFiles()</span>, the directory is now made just before the
    consolidated file is written. This change corrects the error that was introduced in version 588.
