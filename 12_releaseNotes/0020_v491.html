<h1>Nyzo 491: Debugging cleanup</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 491
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/79059d266a37d6712fc4873eef9f33e0927a6f94"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) removes a small block of debugging code.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects neither the sentinel nor verifier in a significant way. It removes a small block of debugging
    code in the sentinel.
</p>

<p>
    In version 490, a small block of debugging code was inadvertently included. This block of code wrote the combined
    mesh to a CSV file on the 100th iteration of the block-transmit loop. It did not cause any significant issues, but
    it was unnecessary clutter. The block of code has been removed in this version.
