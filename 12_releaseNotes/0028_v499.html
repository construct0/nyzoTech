<h1>Nyzo 499: block-file consolidation</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 499
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/ea19c9bccb8e1b15f588474f6cf5ffcefbe6b29e"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) corrects issues with the block-file consolidation process.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects both the verifier and the sentinel.
</p>

<p>
    In development of the server process that uploads files to s3 for the
    <a href="https://nyzo.co/blockFiles" target="_blank">block-file page</a>, we discovered that many of the
    consolidated files on verifiers contained blocks that were invalid due to missing transactions.
    <span class="emphasis">There are multiple complete, valid, independently verifiable copies of every block and every
        transaction since the beginning of the Nyzo blockchain</span>, including the full copy available on s3, but many
    verifiers are not currently maintaining such copies automatically. This version corrects that problem.
</p>

<p>
    Also, this version makes a minor change to the block-file consolidator that should reduce the occurrence of
    out-of-memory problems in the verifier initialization process.
</p>

<p>
    The core of this version is the addition of the <span class="code">validateTransactions</span> argument to one of
    the constructors of the <span class="code">Block</span> class. If a <span class="code">true</span> value is
    provided for this argument, the constructor behaves as it did before. If a <span class="code">false</span> value is
    provided for this argument, the constructor accepts the list of transactions without additional validation.
</p>

<p>
    This change was necessary because of the previous-block-hash field included in transactions. If a verifier cannot
    verify that the previous-block hash is a hash for a block in this blockchain, the transaction is rejected. During
    the production of blocks, availability of referenced blocks is seldom a problem. However, the verifier now bundles
    blocks into consolidated files after the section of 1000 blocks falls behind the retention edge. This means that
    the previous-block hashes of many transactions that were already approved and incorporated into frozen blocks can
    no longer be verified cheaply by the verifier when consolidation takes place. This was causing some transactions in
    historical blocks to be removed from those blocks, thereby corrupting the blocks, during the consolidation process.
</p>

<p>
    For those wishing to see the precise mechanics of the failure, and to see why this fix is viable, the
    <span class="code">fromByteBuffer</span> method of the <span class="code">Transaction</span> class is a good place
    to start. In this method, we see that the block height of the previous-block hash is read from the byte buffer, and
    the hash is retrieved by fetching the block from the <span class="code">BlockManager</span> class. This is where an
    all-zero hash is assigned if the referenced block is now behind the retention edge. This all-zero hash will cause
    the transaction to fail signature validation.
</p>

<p>
    However, all of the other fields of the transaction are correct, and the previous-block hash is not included in the
    serialized form of the transaction, so as long as transaction validation is disabled between the reading of blocks
    from one file and the writing of those blocks to another file, the transactions will pass through the consolidation
    process without issue.
</p>

<p>
    Back to the code changes in this version, two more modifications have been made to the
    <span class="code">Block</span> class. The <span class="code">fromByteBuffer()</span> method has also been given
    a <span class="code">validateTransactions</span> argument. This argument is passed through to the constructor. An
    overload of <span class="code">fromByteBuffer()</span> has the same signature as the old version of the method, and
    it passes a value of <span class="code">true</span> for transaction to the modified version of the method. This
    means that all calls to this method on the old signature behave exactly as they did before.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">BlockManager</span> class, transaction validation is now disabled in three methods:
    <span class="code">loadBlocksInFile()</span>, <span class="code">extractConsolidatedFile()</span>, and
    <span class="code">loadBalanceListFromFile()</span>.
</p>

<p>
    Also, in a related change, the order of the sleep and the <span class="code">consolidateFiles()</span> call have
    been switched in the <span class="code">BlockFileConsolidator</span> processing thread. The consolidator still
    tries to consolidate files every five minutes, but the first attempt is now made five minutes after a verifier
    restart. Verifier initialization is more memory-intensive than normal verifier operation. A verifier with limited
    memory could potentially experience an out-of-memory condition if it attempted to consolidate block files during the
    verifier initialization process.

<p>
    For the suggestion that the block-file consolidation process might be involved in the out-of-memory conditions
    experienced by some verifiers in the initialization process,
