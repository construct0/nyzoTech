<h1>Nyzo 629: Micropay error feedback</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 629
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/dc873eb5112c95b7075f3675ef1c41a9483c4eef"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds detailed feedback from the documentation server when a Micropay
    transaction is not accepted.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the documentation server.
</p>

<p>
    The documentation server provides a reference implementation of Micropay content delivery. Addition of
    <span class="filename">.micropay</span> files alongside content prevents the content from being delivered without
    payment.
</p>

<p>
    The documentation server applies a 6-factor test before delivering content. If a request for Micropay content fails,
    the server now provides human-readable feedback in the <span class="code-mb">402 (Payment Required)</span> response
    letting the client know why the content was not delivered.
</p>

<p>
    All changes in this version are in the <span class="code-mb">Documentation<wbr>Endpoint</span> class. A new
    <span class="code-mb">String<wbr>Builder</span>, <span class="code-mb">micropay<wbr>Failure</span>, is now passed to
    the <span class="code-mb">micropay<wbr>Authorized()</span> method. In the event of failure, the assembled
    <span class="code-mb">String</span> is then passed to the
    <span class="code-mb">get<wbr>Response<wbr>For<wbr>Invalid<wbr>Micropay()</span> method.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code-mb">micropay<wbr>Authorized()</span> method lets the Micropay sender know if a transaction was
    not provided or if a supplemental transaction was not provided. While these seem like simple, obvious errors, all
    errors are easier to resolve when appropriate feedback is provided.
</p>

<p>
    A message is also provided letting the user know if the failure is due to no response from the client. Such an error
    would let an end user know that a failure might be temporary, or it might let the operator of a web server know that
    the selected Nyzo client is unreliable and a different Nyzo client should be used.

<p>
    If the 6-factor test fails, each condition is examined again. Detailed error messages are provided explaining each
    failed case.
</p>

<p>
    To provide more helpful feedback, all six conditions are examined, even if earlier conditions fail. This allows a
    user to see all issues that must be corrected instead of only seeing the first issue that triggered the failure.

<p>
    The failure cause is now included in the <span class="code-mb">402 (Payment Required)</span> response that is
    generated when Micropay authorization fails.
