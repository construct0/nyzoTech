<h1>Nyzo 488: transaction verification</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 488
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/2218572059c9776ec17feb59dbf7c9405f35de9f"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds use of the
    <span class="code">BalanceManager.approvedTransactionsForBlock()</span> method for blocks produced by other
    verifiers.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects both the verifier and the sentinel.
</p>

<p>
    A member of the community, reviewing the Nyzo code, noticed that the
    <span class="code">approvedTransactionsForBlock()</span> method of the
    <span class="code">BalanceManager</span> class was not in the code path for blocks
    originating from other verifiers. This method was only used for blocks created locally by the verifier and
    sentinel processes. This was an unintentional oversight in the code, and the
    <a href="v479" target="_blank">release notes for version 479</a> state clearly that the method is supposed to be in
    the code paths for both locally produced blocks and blocks produced by other systems.
</p>

<p>
    After a verifier or sentinel has started tracking the blockchain, no balance lists are received from other systems.
    They are all calculated locally, and the hash of the locally produced balance list is compared against the hash
    of the balance list in blocks produced by other systems. This means that the balance list derivation process can
    be used for removing invalid transactions.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">balanceListForNextBlock</span> method of the <span class="code">Block</span> class, an
    invocation of the <span class="code">approvedTransactionsForBlock</span> method was added before the processing of
    transactions. The <span class="code">previousBlock</span> variable is only null for the Genesis block, so this
    method will be called for all new blocks. You can confirm that <span class="code">previousBlock</span> is only null
    for the Genesis block by looking at the code earlier in this same method, where
    <span class="code">blockHeight</span> is set to 0 when <span class="code">previousBlock</span> is null.

<p class="emphasis">
    While the omission of this method in the code path for incoming blocks was a serious mistake, there are no practical
    avenues of attack enabled by it. Other checks in the code, intended as redundancies, were protecting against
    malicious transactions that might have been injected into blocks produced by other verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, the seed-funding account protections introduced version 479 would not be effective against
    transactions in received blocks with the error in the code. Our test cases for version 479 all passed due to
    other protections and the fact that we were unable to test transactions with valid signatures from the seed-funding
    account, as we do not have the private key for the account. However theoretical, this version does close that
    vulnerability.
</p>

<p>
    As an additional redundancy, one more change was added to this version. In the
    <span class="code">approvedTransactionsForBlock</span> method, all transactions under &micro;1 are removed. A
    combination of other logic in the balance list calculation was already protecting against malicious transactions
    with negative values, but explicit removal of such transactions is prudent.
