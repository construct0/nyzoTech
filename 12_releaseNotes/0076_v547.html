<h1>Nyzo 547: sentinel join blocks</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 547
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/e70acf1605ba057c93439369c297073428f9d4ee"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) gives the sentinel the ability to send blocks for verifiers joining the
    cycle.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the sentinel and the verifier.
</p>

<p>
    On the surface, sending blocks for new verifiers seems like an obvious, relatively simple modification to the
    sentinel. However, when details of implementation and required information are considered, troubling complexities
    creep into a number of possible solutions.
</p>

<p>
    The obvious major difference between verifiers and sentinels is the number of verifier identifiers for which each is
    responsible. The sentinel must consider the health of every verifier it manages, and misunderstandings about the
    state of new-verifier voting could cause the sentinel to transmit a block for an incorrect new verifier. This could
    leave in-cycle verifiers unprotected for a block.
</p>

<p>
    In order to maintain robust protection for in-cycle verifiers, the sentinel must have a separate process for
    determining which out-of-cycle verifier to assist. However, knowing which verifier to assist requires knowledge of
    new-verifier voting, which is only available to in-cycle verifiers. While many users trying to join the cycle
    already have in-cycle verifiers, many others do not, so this raises concerns about potentially more-effective
    behavior for sentinels that have access to in-cycle verifiers. Such behavior would hurt cycle diversity, which makes
    it unacceptable.
</p>

<p>
    The solution contained in this version is, fundamentally, a brute-force solution. At appropriate times, the sentinel
    sends blocks for every out-of-cycle verifier it manages. However, these transmissions occur selectively,
    efficiently, and at a time when cycle messaging activity is at a relatively low level. So, they will not adversely
    affect cycle performance now, and they will not adversely affect cycle performance even if the queue grows to be
    substantially larger than it is now.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Block.getMinimumVoteTimestamp()</span>, the previous logic has been encapsulated in
    <span class="code">BlockManager.likelyAcceptingNewVerifiers()</span>. Similar logic was introduced in other places
    in the code in this version, and the method was added to improve readability. The logic has actually changed
    slightly: the previous method looked at the height of the block being processed and the new method looks at the
    height of the frozen edge. However, both calculations are rough approximations of a more complex cycle calculation,
    and they are close enough to one another to be considered interchangeable.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager</span>, the <span class="code">likelyAcceptingNewVerifiers()</span> method has
    been added. For additional safety, the frozen edge and the cycle information of the frozen edge are ensured to be
    non-null before being accessed.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">MeshListener</span>, <span class="code">udpBufferSize</span> has been modified. The overhead
    of a message is always 110 bytes. The UDP buffer previously had room for message payloads as large as block votes,
    which occupy 8 bytes for block height, 32 bytes for the block hash, and 8 bytes for the timestamp, for a total UDP
    buffer size of 158 bytes. The size is now 182 bytes to allow the 72-byte <span class="code">MinimumBlock</span>
    payload, which has an 8-byte timestamp and a 64-byte signature, to be received over UDP.
</p>

<p>
    In processing of the UDP messages, the type is now checked before full processing of the message. The Nyzo code
    generally avoids bit-shift operations, as they tend to be difficult to read and easy to write incorrectly. However,
    the efficiency provided in this case justifies one difficult-to-read line of code. Minimal-block messages are
    processed in a new method, and other UDP messages are processed as they were processed in the previous version.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">processMinimalBlockMessage()</span> method, a number of checks are performed to avoid
    processing for messages other than those received at the correct time from the correct identifier. If the block
    appears to be coming from the top new verifier, the full block is rebuilt. If the rebuilt block is valid, it is
    registered with <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0547/rn_547_4.png" alt="RN_547 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 580px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message.processContent()</span>, a case has been added for
    <span class="code">MinimalBlock</span> messages.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">MessageType</span>, values have been added for minimal blocks and the corresponding response.
    Though the response is unused in the current version of code, a type has been put in place so that it will be
    available if a TCP form of this message is ever required.
</p>

<p>
    Also in <span class="code">MessageType</span>, a map has been added for quick lookup of message types from their
    corresponding integer values. Additionally, a script used to generate a Javascript file for an early version of the
    nyzo.co website has been removed.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">MessageType.forValue()</span> uses the new map to replace the comically inefficient iterative
    method. Aside from efficiency, the behavior is unchanged.
</p>

<img src="images/0547/rn_547_8.png" alt="RN_547 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 330px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteManager</span>, the top verifier is now stored in a field so that it can be
    provided more efficiently. The previous method that would calculate and return the top verifier on demand has been
    modified to refresh the top verifier and store it in this field. Previously, the
    <span class="code">topVerifier()</span> method was used infrequently, so the on-demand calculation was not a
    concern. Its new use in <span class="code">MeshListener.processMinimalBlockMessage()</span>, which is used in the
    performance-sensitive UDP processing loop, required a more efficient solution.
</p>

<img src="images/0547/rn_547_9.png" alt="RN_547 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">reset()</span> method was added to the <span class="code">PersistentData</span> class to
    streamline resetting the state of verifiers in the testnet.
</p>

<img src="images/0547/rn_547_10.png" alt="RN_547 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 220px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Verifier</span>, the top new verifier is updated each time a block is frozen.
</p>

<img src="images/0547/rn_547_11.png" alt="RN_547 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 560px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">MinimalBlock</span> class encapsulates the timestamp and block signature of a block. All
    other fields can be implicitly derived by the receiver of the block.
</p>

<img src="images/0547/rn_547_12.png" alt="RN_547 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 360px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Sentinel</span>, a separate thread is started for sending blocks for new verifiers. As
    recent issues have clearly illustrated, even seemingly innocuous changes to the sentinel can cause serious problems.
    Keeping the new-verifier process completely separate from protection of in-cycle verifiers provides a small
    assurance that in-cycle verifier protection will not be compromised by the changes in this version.
</p>

<img src="images/0547/rn_547_13.png" alt="RN_547 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 370px;">

<p>
    The sentinel thread that sends blocks for new verifiers is simple. At appropriate heights, blocks are created and
    broadcast for every out-of-cycle verifier that the sentinel manages.
</p>

<img src="images/0547/rn_547_14.png" alt="RN_547 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 560px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">broadcastUdpBlockForNewVerifier()</span> method uses the same
    <span class="code">createNextBlock()</span> method that is used for in-cycle verifiers. However, instead of sending
    the full block, a <span class="code">MinimalBlock</span> message, containing only the block signature and
    verification timestamp, is sent.
</p>

<img src="images/0547/rn_547_15.png" alt="RN_547 code 15" class="code-image" style="width: 530px;">

<p>
    Sentinel transactions are not added to blocks created for out-of-cycle verifiers.
</p>

<img src="images/0547/rn_547_16.png" alt="RN_547 code 16" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">UpdateUtil.reset()</span>, the new <span class="code">PersistentData.reset()</span> method is
    now called. The reset process would rarely, if ever, be used to reset verifiers on the production blockchain.
    However, for the testnet, this method is a convenient way to restart an existing mesh with a new Genesis block.
</p>

<img src="images/0547/rn_547_17.png" alt="RN_547 code 17" class="code-image" style="width: 530px;">

<p>
    Thoroughly testing this update on the production blockchain was impractical. Various modifications were made to the
    logic to allow <span class="code">MinimalBlock</span> messages to be transmitted and processed, but a complete test
    would have required the ability to manipulate the new-verifier voting among the cycle. Obviously, we do not have
    such power. So, a small testnet was configured, and manual vote overrides for a non-existent verifier were sent to
    all in-cycle verifiers in the testnet. A sentinel was then started to manage that verifier identifier, and the
    minimal block broadcast by the sentinel allowed that verifier to join in every test conducted.
</p>

<p>
    In additional to sentinels needing to update to begin sending blocks for new verifiers, the verifiers currently in
    the cycle will need to update to receive those blocks. However, even a single verifier running this version would
    likely be sufficient for relaying sentinel blocks to the cycle. When a verifier receives a block that deserves a
    block vote, that vote is sent almost immediately, which triggers other verifiers to start requesting the missing
    block. Due to this mechanism, blocks are quickly distributed throughout the cycle, even if their initial
    distribution is poor.
