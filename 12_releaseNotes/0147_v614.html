<h1>Nyzo 614: client node management</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 614
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/6f0606f44ea36b63ebc21a411e70bfbb8776011a"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) improves management of nodes in
    <span class="code">ClientNodeManager</span>, imposing a maximum number of nodes and implementing a scoring system to
    track node performance.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the client only.
</p>

<p>
    The client plays an interesting role in the Nyzo ecosystem. It serves as a bridge to the mesh, providing a
    traditional web interface and API server. It provides these in a decentralized fashion, unlike the
    <a href="https://nyzo.co" target="_blank">nyzo.co web server</a>. Anyone can set up their own copy of the client
    quickly and easily, on a modest virtual server and without control of any in-cycle nodes, to provide their own
    window into the Nyzo blockchain. While we provide
    <a href="https://client.nyzo.co" target="_blank">client.nyzo.co</a> as a convenience, we hope that many more client
    instances will be established as Nyzo adoption increases.
</p>

<p>
    This version improves client mesh management to improve robustness of client blockchain tracking. This will
    significantly reduce the effort required to maintain a client instance.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">ClientDataManager</span>, counters were added for
    <span class="code">numberOfNonPreferredBlockFetches</span> and
    <span class="code">numberOfPreferredBlockFetches</span>. These are for monitoring only. Accessors were added to
    expose the values to the <span class="code">ClientHealthCommand</span>.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">ClientDataManager.requestBlockWithVotes()</span>, a preferred node is now requested when the
    number of consecutive failures is odd. The appropriate counter is incremented in both cases.
</p>

<img src="images/0614/rn_614_1.png" alt="RN_614 image 1" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 210px;">

<p>
    Success and failure is marked for each response. This is used by the <span class="code">ClientNodeManager</span> for
    performance scoring.
</p>

<img src="images/0614/rn_614_2.png" alt="RN_614 image 2" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 420px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">ClientNodeManager</span>, constants were added to bound the scoring system. A
    <span class="code">maximumMapSize</span> was added to protect memory, and the <span class="code">nodes</span> map
    was replaced with two maps to allow node scores to be tracked. Lists were added for efficient pseudorandom lookup of
    nodes in the preferred and general node pools, and a <span class="code">BiFunction</span> was added for thread-safe
    tallying of scores.
</p>

<img src="images/0614/rn_614_3.png" alt="RN_614 image 3" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 370px;">

<p>
    Each time a <span class="code">Node</span> is present in a <span class="code">MeshResponse</span>, its score
    increases by 1. After the mesh response is processed, nodes are removed to ensure the maps do not exceed the
    maximum allowable size and to ensure that no nodes with scores of <span class="code">0</span> remain.
</p>

<p>
    The last section of the <span class="code">ClientNodeManager.processMeshResponse()</span> method rebuilds the lists
    that are used to provide nodes to clients of the class through the <span class="code">randomNode()</span> and
    <span class="code">randomPreferredNode()</span> methods. The calculation for determining preferred nodes is
    explained in the comment.
</p>

<p>
    The method for providing a <span class="code">randomNode()</span> is simpler due to the new
    <span class="code">allNodes</span> list. The <span class="code">randomElement()</span> method is no longer
    necessary. A new method provides a <span class="code">randomPreferredNode()</span>.
    The <span class="code">getMesh()</span> method references one of the new maps, and the
    <span class="code">getNumberOfNodes()</span> method references the new <span class="code">allNodes</span> list. The
    <span class="code">getNumberOfPreferredNodes()</span> method provides additional information to the
    <span class="code">ClientHealthCommand</span>.
</p>

<p>
    The client-health command displays the following new information:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>number of preferred nodes in mesh</li>
    <li>number of fetches from non-preferred nodes (the full node pool)</li>
    <li>number of fetches from preferred nodes</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The rest of the commit is testing code. This is a typical <span class="code">NyzoTest</span>, and it includes a
    <span class="code">main()</span> method to allow it to be run independently of the other tests. The
    <span class="code">batchSize</span> and <span class="code">numberOfBatches</span> are constants for which many
    different values allow the test to complete successfully. There are also many values that can be assigned to these
    constants for which the test will not complete successfully. This is due to limitations of the test, not limitations
    of the <span class="code">ClientNodeManager</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0614/rn_614_8.png" alt="RN_614 image 8" class="code-image" style="width: 310px; max-height: 270px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">ClientNodeManagerTest.run()</span> method implements the test logic. Nodes are added to the
    <span class="code">ClientNodeManager</span>. The same nodes are then added again, which increases their scores.
    Successes are marked, and failures are marked. The number of nodes and number of preferred nodes are checked after
    each operation.
</p>

<p>
    Lastly, the map size limit is tested.
</p>

<img src="images/0614/rn_614_10.png" alt="RN_614 image 10" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 190px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">ClientNodeManagerTest.addNodes()</span> method creates simple <span class="code">Node</span>
    objects for testing, and it performs the full and preferred size checks.
</p>

<img src="images/0614/rn_614_11.png" alt="RN_614 image 11" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 250px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">ClientNodeManagerTest.markSuccesses()</span> method simulates successful block fetches and
    performs size checks.
</p>

<img src="images/0614/rn_614_12.png" alt="RN_614 image 12" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 250px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">ClientNodeManagerTest.markFailures()</span> method simulates unsuccessful block fetches and
    performs size checks.
</p>

<img src="images/0614/rn_614_13.png" alt="RN_614 image 13" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 250px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">ClientNodeManagerTest.nodeWithTagAndIndex()</span> method produces simple nodes for testing.
    The <span class="code">ClientNodeManagerTest.getFailureCause()</span> method provides a description of any failure
    that the test encounters.
</p>

<img src="images/0614/rn_614_14.png" alt="RN_614 image 14" class="code-image" style="width: 380px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">TestUtil</span> suite now includes the <span class="code">ClientNodeManagerTest</span>.
</p>
