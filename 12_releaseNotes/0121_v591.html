<h1>Nyzo 591: block registration</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 591
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/4797edcd9d87da8ca385f8aafacd60712ebdccc1"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) modifies block registration to avoid blockchain stalls.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the verifier.
</p>

<p>
    The blockchain has stalled several times in the past few days, always on a new verifier. The mesh is in an odd state
    of disagreement right now regarding lottery results. This is being thoroughly investigated.
</p>

<p>
    The consensus process, though, is designed to and must be able to work through disagreements. The scoring change of
    version 590 provided the means for verifiers to work through new-verifier disagreements. However, the
    <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager</span> was sabotaging the process by discarding the leading block in many
    cases.
</p>

<p>
    This version adds a condition that forces the <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager</span> to register the leading
    block even if it is the highest-scored block, and even if the map is currently beyond its intended maximum size.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.registerBlock()</span>, a check of the leading hash was added. If the
    block that is chosen for removal is currently leading in voting, it is allowed to remain in the map.
