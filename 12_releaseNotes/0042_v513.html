<h1>Nyzo 513: node-join improvement</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 513
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/d51ac1d8eb43e02f44000ea4b5d59ae5633e3af9"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) improves the node-join process.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version only affects the verifier, and the changes are minor. This version can be skipped if you find its
    changes uninteresting. This version was released now because its changes are necessary to allow the Nyzo verifiers
    to continue to provide complete, accurate mesh information to the Nyzo web server.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">NodeManager</span>, the current mesh is now enqueued for node-join requests along with the
    mesh provided by another node. This ensures that all nodes known to <span class="code">NodeManager</span> are
    queried once per reloading of the node-join queue.

<p>
    In <span class="code">MeshResponse</span>, lists of nodes that exceed the maximum count are randomized before
    culling. This prevents the same set of nodes from being removed from every response.
