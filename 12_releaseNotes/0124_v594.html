<h1>Nyzo 594: maintenance</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 594
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/556cf38246ca2c8efb27685434f25ef6238ba3b3"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) includes only inconsequential code maintenance.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects all run modes, but none of the changes are significant.
</p>

<p>
    These changes, all minor maintenance, are being released now to reduce the size of subsequent updates. There is no
    need to update to this version.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager</span>, an unused import was removed. Imports are not typically discussed in
    release notes. This one is mentioned because it is the only change in the file.

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockVoteManager</span>, an unnecessary <span class="code">null</span> check was removed. An
    earlier condition already assured that <span class="code">vote</span> was not <span class="code">null</span>.
</p>

<p>
    Synchronization was removed from <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.getHeights()</span>. This method was already
    thread-safe.

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message</span>, a field was added to allow unsafe messages to be sent. This is used by some
    scripts that are not yet published.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">NyzoStringType</span> enumeration, the unused <span class="code">data</span> field was
    removed.
</p>
