<h1>Nyzo 515: performance improvements</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 515
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/f11274574f8fcef889b8c42e0be37338b088b095"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) improves performance of the verifier and reduces the time required to
    resynchronize with the blockchain after a verifier outage.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version primarily affects the verifier. While some of the modified code paths are used by the sentinel, this
    version does not affect operation of the sentinel significantly.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager</span>, a set containing all current- and near-cycle
    <span class="code">Node</span> objects has been added.
</p>

<p>
    The methods for retrieving in-cycle identifiers have been changed to return a reference to the local object instead
    of a copy of that object. While this does expose the local objects to modification by other classes, it eliminates
    the processing and memory overhead related to the copy. The method that returned the set of all current- and
    near-cycle identifiers has been replaced by a method that returns the set of current- and near-cycle
    <span class="code">Node</span> objects.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">updateVerifiersInCurrentCycle()</span> method, the identifier sets have been changed to
    use concurrent sets, and building of the set of <span class="code">Node</span> objects has been added.
</p>

<p>
    The minimum interval between requests for missing block votes has been changed from 2 seconds to 1 second to
    improve recovery speed after blockchain-tracking problems.
</p>

<p>
    Request of missing block votes has been replaced with the block-with-votes request used by out-of-cycle verifiers.
    Request of individual missing votes requires one message to be sent to every verifier in the cycle. The bundled
    block-with-votes request requires only a single message.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">Message</span> class, the new set of current- and near-cycle nodes is now used for
    broadcasts. Instead of iterating over the entire mesh and checking each node for cycle membership, iteration
    now takes place over the cycle only.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager</span>, the static maps have been replaced with concurrent versions, and
    synchronization has been removed from all methods.
</p>

<p>
    Rejection of future-timestamped blocks has been activated. The entire cycle has now adopted the code that penalizes
    such blocks with an invalid chain score, so there is no longer a danger that such a block will be frozen.
</p>

<img src="images/0515/rn_515_7.png" alt="RN_515 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 475px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">UnfrozenBlocksAtHeight</span> method has been rewritten to eliminate the possibility of a
    null-pointer exception due to a race condition.
</p>

<img src="images/0515/rn_515_8.png" alt="RN_515 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 451px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">Verifier</span> class, visibility of <span class="code">requestBlockWithVotes</span> has
    been modified to allow the <span class="code">BlockVoteManager</span> class to use it to request missing votes.
</p>

<img src="images/0515/rn_515_9.png" alt="RN_515 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 237px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">VerifierPerformanceManager</span>, an additional null check has been implemented. Review of
    log files showed that the vote map was sometimes null, resulting in an exception.
