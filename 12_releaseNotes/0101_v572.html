<h1>Nyzo 572: NodeManager stability</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 572
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/f2b289780f7c443bb4313ba404f34b9fba60c58b"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) improves control of memory use in <span class="code">NodeManager</span>.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the verifier only. This is the only run mode that uses the
    <span class="code">NodeManager</span>.
</p>

<p>
    The openness of the Nyzo verifier, with its willingness to accept information on incoming connections, makes it
    especially susceptible to resource-consumption attacks. In the past, various potential attacks have been found by
    members of the community. The <span class="code">NicknameManager</span> issue, addressed in
    <a href="v500">version 500</a>, resulted in a &cap;75,000 bounty. The signature-buffer issue, addressed in
    <a href="v503">version 503</a>, resulted in a &cap;225,000 bounty. The <span class="code">TIME_WAIT</span> issue,
    addressed in <a href="v539">version 539</a>, resulted in a &cap;30,000 bounty.
</p>

<p>
    We will not recommend a specific bounty amount for this issue. We encourage the cycle to provide a bounty that
    appropriately acknowledges the value that report of this issue provides to the community. The fixes in this build
    eliminate a vulnerability that, if exploited correctly, could have resulted in a cycle stall, tremendous hassle for
    operators of verifiers, and loss of verification positions in the cycle.
</p>

<p>
    Also, we ask that the cycle considers the <span class="code">NodeManager</span> improvements in
    <a href="v570">version 570</a> when determining the bounty. Those improvements were due to this report, but the
    report was not mentioned at the time due to the incomplete nature of the fixes in that version.
</p>

<p>
    As the current cycle transaction mechanism is frustratingly unreliable, we do feel that delaying bounty transactions
    until the deployment of <a href="/teamTechnologyProposals/nttp3">NTTP-3</a> is warranted.
</p>

<p>
    The reporters of this issue have provided the following addresses for receiving a bounty:

</ul>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Node</span>, the <span class="code">communicationFailureInactiveThreshold</span> constant and
    <span class="code">communicationFailureCount</span> field were added to encapsulate communication failure
    information. The <span class="code">identifierChangeTimestamp</span> was eliminated, as there is no longer a
    restriction on frequency of IP changes.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_0.png" alt="RN_572 code 0" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 290px">

<p>
    The methods for getting and setting <span class="code">identifierChangeTimestamp</span> were removed.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_1.png" alt="RN_572 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 100px">

<p>
    Indentation of the <span class="code">isActive()</span> method was corrected. The
    <span class="code">markSuccessfulConnection()</span> and <span class="code">markFailedConnection()</span> methods
    were added to track reachability.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_2.png" alt="RN_572 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 270px">

<p>
    In <span class="code">NodeManager</span>, the <span class="code">consecutiveFailuresBeforeRemoval</span> constant
    and <span class="code">ipAddressToFailureCountMap</span> field used for reachability were removed. Their
    functionality is now encapsulated in the <span class="code">Node</span> class.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">maximumNodesPerInCycleVerifier</span> and <span class="code">maximumNewNodeMapSize</span>
    constants were added for enforcing new limits. The <span class="code">newNodeIpToPortMap</span> field stores nodes
    that have sent node joins to this verifier but have not yet been added to the main map of nodes,
    <span class="code">ipAddressToNodeMap</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_3.png" alt="RN_572 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 160px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">meshRequestWait</span> and <span class="code">meshRequestSuccessCount</span> fields were both
    changed from <span class="code">int</span> to <span class="code">AtomicInteger</span> to improve thread safety.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_4.png" alt="RN_572 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 390px; max-height: 70px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">NodeManager.updateNode()</span> that takes a <span class="code">Message</span> argument, a
    check is performed to determine whether the message is a node-join response. Responses are not processed in the
    <span class="code">MeshListener</span>, so a response would only be available as a result of an outgoing node-join
    message sent by this verifier.
</p>

<p>
    The other overload of <span class="code">updateNode()</span> no longer returns a <span class="code">boolean</span>
    value to indicate whether the node was added to the map, and node joins are no longer immediately sent when a new
    node is encountered.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_5.png" alt="RN_572 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 210px;">

<p>
    When <span class="code">updateNode()</span> is called with a message of type
    <span class="code">MissingBlockVoteRequest23</span> or <span class="code">MissingBlockRequest25</span>, a successful
    connection is registered on the node. This has the same effect as the previous
    <span class="code">setInactiveTimestamp()</span> method call, but code readability and encapsulation are improved.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_6.png" alt="RN_572 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 110px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">NodeManager.addTemporaryLocalVerifierEntry()</span>, a <span class="code">true</span> value is
    passed for the new argument of <span class="code">updateNode()</span>. This causes the temporary entry to be added
    to the primary map immediately.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_7.png" alt="RN_572 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 290px; max-height: 60px;">

<p>
    For the private overload of <span class="code">updateNode()</span>, synchronization was removed and the
    <span class="code">isNodeJoinResponse</span> argument was added. The return value was eliminated. The logic was
    reorganized to have fewer cases.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_8.png" alt="RN_572 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 470px; max-height: 350px;">

<p>
    At the top level, there are now only two cases. If the IP address and identifier are the same as those of a node
    already in the map, the ports are updated and a successful connection is marked. In all other situations, the node
    is treated as a new node, being removed from the map if a node is already present at the IP. Note that the result of
    removing and re-adding a node to the map is similar to the result of the previous logic, which reset queue
    timestamps when identifiers changed. The new logic, though, is simpler and easier to protect from memory attacks.
</p>

<p>
    If the node is in the cycle, or if the update is due to a node-join response, the node is immediately added to the
    primary map, <span class="code">ipAddressToNodeMap</span>. This is subject to a maximum of
    <span class="code">6</span> nodes per identifier. This limit allows suitable leeway for backup and replacement
    nodes. Inactive nodes are eventually removed from the map, so there is no concern that cumulative IP changes for a
    node will limit the ability to add new nodes.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_9.png" alt="RN_572 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 460px; max-height: 370px;">

<p>
    All out-of-cycle nodes that are not due to node-join responses are added to a size-limited map for later querying.
    While this does not impose a limit on the memory usage of the <span class="code">NodeManager</span>, it does impose
    a limit of the rate of increase of memory usage.
</p>

<p>
    As before, the temporary entry is removed if an actual entry for the verifier is encountered.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_10.png" alt="RN_572 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 250px;">

<p>
    Synchronization was removed from the <span class="code">demoteIdentifier()</span> method. The
    <span class="code">ipAddressToNodeMap</span> is a <span class="code">ConcurrentHashMap</span>, so this method is
    thread-safe.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_11.png" alt="RN_572 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 50px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">NodeManager.markFailedConnection()</span> method is now basically a pass-through to the
    <span class="code">Node.markFailedConnection()</span> method. Marking nodes as inactive due to repeated
    communications failures is now encapsulated in the <span class="code">Node</span> class.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_12.png" alt="RN_572 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 360px; max-height: 230px;">

<p>
    Similarly, the <span class="code">NodeManager.markSuccessfulConnection()</span> method is now essentially a
    pass-through to the <span class="code">Node.markSuccessfulConnection()</span> method.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_13.png" alt="RN_572 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 300px; max-height: 130px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">NodeManager.markNodeAsInactive()</span> was removed. This behavior is now encapsulated in the
    <span class="code">Node</span> class and controlled through <span class="code">Node.markFailedConnection()</span>
    and <span class="code">Node.markSuccessfulConnection()</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_14.png" alt="RN_572 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 300px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    Synchronization was removed from <span class="code">NodeManager.updateActiveVerifiersAndRemoveOldNodes()</span>. All
    code in this method is thread-safe.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_15.png" alt="RN_572 code 15" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 40px;">

<p>
    Synchronization was removed from <span class="code">NodeManager.requestMesh()</span>, and the method was renamed to
    <span class="code">reloadNodeJoinQueue()</span> to better reflect its purpose.
</p>

<p>
    Usage of <span class="code">meshRequestWait</span> was updated for its change from <span class="code">int</span> to
    <span class="code">AtomicInteger</span>. The differing semantics of the post-decrement
    <span class="code">meshRequestWait--</span> and pre-decrement
    <span class="code">meshRequestWait.decrementAndGet()</span> are inconsequential in this situation.
</p>

<p>
    Use of <span class="code">MessageType.FullMeshRequest41</span> was eliminated to further emphasize cycle
    connectivity. Out-of-cycle verifiers should make their presence known to in-cycle verifiers. In-cycle verifiers need
    not actively search for out-of-cycle verifiers.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_16.png" alt="RN_572 code 16" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 250px;">

<p>
    Another usage of <span class="code">meshRequestWait</span> was updated for its changed data type, along with two
    usages of <span class="code">meshRequestSuccessCount</span>.
</p>

<p>
    Node joins are enqueued for all IP addresses in the <span class="code">newNodeIpToPortMap</span>. This is how new
    out-of-cycle nodes are added to the primary map. Previously, nodes would be added immediately when a node-join
    message was received. That means that someone would need to control an IP address for only moments in order to cause
    this verifier to register an entry. Now, control needs to be for much longer, as the verifier reloads its node-join
    queue on its own schedule, and the next reload may be several hours from when the initial join was sent. Thus, an
    inexpensive attack on memory consumption is changed to a situation where the attacker is essentially just another
    out-of-cycle verifier.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_17.png" alt="RN_572 code 17" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 370px;">

<p>
    Synchronization was removed from <span class="code">NodeManager.demoteInCycleNodes</span>. The
    <span class="code">ipAddressToNodeMap</span> is a <span class="code">ConcurrentHashMap</span>, so the method is
    thread-safe.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_18.png" alt="RN_572 code 18" class="code-image" style="width: 250px; max-height: 40px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">NodeManager.persistNodes()</span>, a placeholder is written for the identifier-change
    timestamp. This preserves the structure of the file.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_19.png" alt="RN_572 code 19" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 190px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">NodeManager.loadPersistedNodes()</span>, reading and setting of the identifier-change
    timestamp was removed.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_20.png" alt="RN_572 code 20" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 220px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Verifier.sendNodeJoinMessage()</span>, which sends a node-join to a
    <span class="code">TrustedEntryPoint</span>, the version of the message was updated.
</p>

<img src="images/0572/rn_572_21.png" alt="RN_572 code 21" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Verifier.verifierMain()</span>, comments and a called method's name were updated.
</p>
