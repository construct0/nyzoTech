<h1>Nyzo 476: mesh reopening 2</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 476
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/35cb5510686bdc408f0bce82c461e6f6346ff5b3"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) is the second of two updates to allow the mesh to be reopened for new
    verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">BlacklistManager</span> was added to protect in-cycle verifiers from excess network traffic.
    The <span class="code">blacklistDuration</span>, the time for which an IP address typically remains in the blacklist
    after a violation, is 10 minutes. The <span class="code">useIpTables</span> argument can be changed by an individual
    operator if they do not want the verifier to use the system firewall to restrict connections.
</p>

<p>
    In the static block, all <span class="code">iptables</span> rules are flushed to avoid problems with lingering rules
    that may have been set by a previous instance of the verifier.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistManager.addToBlacklist()</span> adds a single IP address to the blacklist map. The
    address is only added when the <span class="code">BlockManager</span> is initialized and has a complete cycle,
    because erroneous identification of verifiers as being out-of-cycle might happen otherwise.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistManager.inBlacklist()</span> is used to enforce the blacklist.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_2.png" alt="RN_476 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 50px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistManager.getBlacklistSize()</span> is used by
    <span class="code">BlacklistStatusResponse</span> to provide information to the verifier operator.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_3.png" alt="RN_476 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 180px; max-height: 50px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistManager.performMaintenance()</span> removes in-cycle node addresses from the blacklist.
    The allows the blacklist to mitigate attacks or inadvertent bursts from in-cycle verifiers without causing long-term
    mesh connectivity issues.
</p>

<p>
    This method also removes expired nodes from the blacklist to control memory usage.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_4.png" alt="RN_476 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 200px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistManager.setIpTableEntry()</span> runs the <span class="code">iptables</span> command to
    add or remove a firewall entry. The entry, when active, drops TCP packets from the specified source address to the
    <span class="code">MeshListener</span> port.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_5.png" alt="RN_476 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 70px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistManager.runProcess()</span> is a helper method used by the
    <span class="code">setIpTableEntry()</span> method. <span class="code">BlacklistManager.readStream()</span> is a
    helper method used to read the input and error streams of the process in the <span class="code">runProcess()</span>
    method.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_6.png" alt="RN_476 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 340px; max-height: 310px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">Block.chainScore()</span> method, the base offset for a new verifier was changed from
    <span class="code">-6</span> to <span class="code">-2</span>. This gives only the top new verifier a score lower
    than the next in-cycle verifier, where previously the top two new verifiers were assigned scores lower than the next
    in-cycle verifier.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_7.png" alt="RN_476 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 180px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager</span>, the <span class="code">currentAndNearCycleSet</span> was added so that
    top-voted verifiers could be treated similarly to in-cycle verifiers for messaging purposes.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_8.png" alt="RN_476 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 320px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    Synchronization was removed from the <span class="code">BlockManager.verifiersInCurrentCycleList()</span> and
    <span class="code">BlockManager.verifiersInCurrentCycleSet()</span> methods to improve efficiency.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_9.png" alt="RN_476 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 320px; max-height: 110px;">

<p>
    Synchronization was removed from the <span class="code">BlockManager.verifierInCurrentCycle()</span> method, and the
    <span class="code">BlockManager.verifiersInCurrentAndNearCycleSet()</span> method was added. The diff's ordering of
    changes is mildly deceptive.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_10.png" alt="RN_476 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 340px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">BlockManager.verifierInOrNearCurrentCycle()</span> method provides lookup from the
    <span class="code">currentAndNearCycleSet</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_11.png" alt="RN_476 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 320px; max-height: 60px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager.updateVerifiersInCurrentCycle()</span>, the
    <span class="code">currentAndNearCycleSet</span> is populated with the contents of the
    <span class="code">currentCycleList</span> and <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteManager.topVerifiers()</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_12.png" alt="RN_476 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 130px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockVoteManager</span>, the <span class="code">minimumVoteInterval</span> was increased from
    2.0 seconds to 5.0 seconds to improve stability of the voting process. The <span class="code">flipVoteMap</span>
    was added to prevent a verifier's vote from being changed unless the same changed vote was received two consecutive
    times, separated by the <span class="code">minimumVoteInterval</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_13.png" alt="RN_476 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 360px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    The full <span class="code">Message</span> object for a <span class="code">BlockVote</span> is now passed to the
    <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.registerVote()</span> method. The fields of this message are now stored on the
    vote to allow the votes to be shared later in <span class="code">BlockWithVotesResponse</span> objects.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_14.png" alt="RN_476 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    The next section of the diff is largely due to indentation changes. Setting of the
    <span class="code">receiptTimestamp</span>, with the addition of new fields, was just explained. Most of the vote
    registration code pictured here is unchanged. The new code, at lines 51 and 52, is fetching of the existing vote and
    checking whether it is <span class="code">null</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_15.png" alt="RN_476 code 15" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 440px;">

<p>
    If the <span class="code">existingVote</span> is null, the new vote is registered.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_16.png" alt="RN_476 code 16" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 230px;">

<p>
    When a verifier has changed its vote, the <span class="code">flipVoteMap</span> is now used. This is an important
    new protection to avoid one-block forks in the blockchain. Instead of accepting and registering changed votes
    immediately, the changed votes are stored in the <span class="code">flipVoteMap</span>, and a confirmation vote is
    required before the vote is updated in the primary map.

</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_17.png" alt="RN_476 code 17" class="code-image" style="width: 460px; max-height: 290px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.removeOldVotes()</span>, votes are now retained for 40 blocks behind the
    frozen edge to support the <span class="code">BlockWithVotesResponse</span>. The new
    <span class="code">flipVoteMap</span> is cleaned in this method, also.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_18.png" alt="RN_476 code 18" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 160px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.votesAtHeight()</span> was planned to be a temporary entry in the
    <span class="code">StatusResponse</span>. However, it has been more useful than anticipated, so it will be retained.
</p>
