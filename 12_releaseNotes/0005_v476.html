<h1>Nyzo 476: mesh reopening 2</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 476
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/35cb5510686bdc408f0bce82c461e6f6346ff5b3"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) is the second of two updates to allow the mesh to be reopened for new
    verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">BlacklistManager</span> was added to protect in-cycle verifiers from excess network traffic.
    The <span class="code">blacklistDuration</span>, the time for which an IP address typically remains in the blacklist
    after a violation, is 10 minutes. The <span class="code">useIpTables</span> argument can be changed by an individual
    operator if they do not want the verifier to use the system firewall to restrict connections.
</p>

<p>
    In the static block, all <span class="code">iptables</span> rules are flushed to avoid problems with lingering rules
    that may have been set by a previous instance of the verifier.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistManager.addToBlacklist()</span> adds a single IP address to the blacklist map. The
    address is only added when the <span class="code">BlockManager</span> is initialized and has a complete cycle,
    because erroneous identification of verifiers as being out-of-cycle might happen otherwise.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_1.png" alt="RN_476 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 310px; max-height: 110px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistManager.inBlacklist()</span> is used to enforce the blacklist.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_2.png" alt="RN_476 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 50px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistManager.getBlacklistSize()</span> is used by
    <span class="code">BlacklistStatusResponse</span> to provide information to the verifier operator.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_3.png" alt="RN_476 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 180px; max-height: 50px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistManager.performMaintenance()</span> removes in-cycle node addresses from the blacklist.
    The allows the blacklist to mitigate attacks or inadvertent bursts from in-cycle verifiers without causing long-term
    mesh connectivity issues.
</p>

<p>
    This method also removes expired nodes from the blacklist to control memory usage.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_4.png" alt="RN_476 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 200px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistManager.setIpTableEntry()</span> runs the <span class="code">iptables</span> command to
    add or remove a firewall entry. The entry, when active, drops TCP packets from the specified source address to the
    <span class="code">MeshListener</span> port.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_5.png" alt="RN_476 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 70px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistManager.runProcess()</span> is a helper method used by the
    <span class="code">setIpTableEntry()</span> method. <span class="code">BlacklistManager.readStream()</span> is a
    helper method used to read the input and error streams of the process in the <span class="code">runProcess()</span>
    method.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_6.png" alt="RN_476 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 340px; max-height: 310px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">Block.chainScore()</span> method, the base offset for a new verifier was changed from
    <span class="code">-6</span> to <span class="code">-2</span>. This gives only the top new verifier a score lower
    than the next in-cycle verifier, where previously the top two new verifiers were assigned scores lower than the next
    in-cycle verifier.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_7.png" alt="RN_476 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 180px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager</span>, the <span class="code">currentAndNearCycleSet</span> was added so that
    top-voted verifiers could be treated similarly to in-cycle verifiers for messaging purposes.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_8.png" alt="RN_476 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 320px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    Synchronization was removed from the <span class="code">BlockManager.verifiersInCurrentCycleList()</span> and
    <span class="code">BlockManager.verifiersInCurrentCycleSet()</span> methods to improve efficiency.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_9.png" alt="RN_476 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 320px; max-height: 110px;">

<p>
    Synchronization was removed from the <span class="code">BlockManager.verifierInCurrentCycle()</span> method, and the
    <span class="code">BlockManager.verifiersInCurrentAndNearCycleSet()</span> method was added. The diff's ordering of
    changes is mildly deceptive.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_10.png" alt="RN_476 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 340px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">BlockManager.verifierInOrNearCurrentCycle()</span> method provides lookup from the
    <span class="code">currentAndNearCycleSet</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_11.png" alt="RN_476 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 320px; max-height: 60px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager.updateVerifiersInCurrentCycle()</span>, the
    <span class="code">currentAndNearCycleSet</span> is populated with the contents of the
    <span class="code">currentCycleList</span> and <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteManager.topVerifiers()</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_12.png" alt="RN_476 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 130px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockVoteManager</span>, the <span class="code">minimumVoteInterval</span> was increased from
    2.0 seconds to 5.0 seconds to improve stability of the voting process. The <span class="code">flipVoteMap</span>
    was added to prevent a verifier's vote from being changed unless the same changed vote was received two consecutive
    times, separated by the <span class="code">minimumVoteInterval</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_13.png" alt="RN_476 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 360px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    The full <span class="code">Message</span> object for a <span class="code">BlockVote</span> is now passed to the
    <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.registerVote()</span> method. The fields of this message are now stored on the
    vote to allow the votes to be shared later in <span class="code">BlockWithVotesResponse</span> objects.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_14.png" alt="RN_476 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    The next section of the diff is largely due to indentation changes. Setting of the
    <span class="code">receiptTimestamp</span>, with the addition of new fields, was just explained. Most of the vote
    registration code pictured here is unchanged. The new code, at lines 51 and 52, is fetching of the existing vote and
    checking whether it is <span class="code">null</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_15.png" alt="RN_476 code 15" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 440px;">

<p>
    If the <span class="code">existingVote</span> is null, the new vote is registered.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_16.png" alt="RN_476 code 16" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 230px;">

<p>
    When a verifier has changed its vote, the <span class="code">flipVoteMap</span> is now used. This is an important
    new protection to avoid one-block forks in the blockchain. Instead of accepting and registering changed votes
    immediately, the changed votes are stored in the <span class="code">flipVoteMap</span>, and a confirmation vote is
    required before the vote is updated in the primary map.

</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_17.png" alt="RN_476 code 17" class="code-image" style="width: 460px; max-height: 290px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.removeOldVotes()</span>, votes are now retained for 40 blocks behind the
    frozen edge to support the <span class="code">BlockWithVotesResponse</span>. The new
    <span class="code">flipVoteMap</span> is cleaned in this method, also.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_18.png" alt="RN_476 code 18" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 160px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.votesAtHeight()</span> was planned to be a temporary entry in the
    <span class="code">StatusResponse</span>. However, it has been more useful than anticipated, so it will be retained.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_19.png" alt="RN_476 code 19" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 40px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.numberOfVotesAtHeight()</span> provides the size of the vote map at the
    specified height. This is used in <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.updateVote()</span> to delay attempts to
    reach consensus until a suitable number of votes for the height have been tabulated.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_20.png" alt="RN_476 code 20" class="code-image" style="width: 300px; max-height: 70px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.getLocalVotes()</span> was removed. This method was previously used by
    <span class="code">NodeJoinResponse</span>, but it is no longer included in the updated, less burdensome
    initialization process.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_21.png" alt="RN_476 code 21" class="code-image" style="width: 370px; max-height: 130px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.requestMissingVotes()</span>, fallback wait times were reduced to improve the
    speed of consensus when votes have been dropped. The call to <span class="code">registerVote()</span> now passes the
    entire <span class="code">Message</span> instead of just the identifier and <span class="code">BlockVote</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_22.png" alt="RN_476 code 22" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 300px;">

<p>
    Some log statements that were no longer needed were removed from
    <span class="code">ChainInitializationManager</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_23.png" alt="RN_476 code 23" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 180px;">

<p>
    Counters were added to <span class="code">MeshListener</span> to track how many messages are accepted and rejected
    under the new message rules.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_24.png" alt="RN_476 code 24" class="code-image" style="width: 240px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    In the outer thread of <span class="code">MeshListener.start()</span>, the inline inner thread started in response
    to accepted sockets has been removed.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_25.png" alt="RN_476 code 25" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 250px;">

<p>
    The replacement code first checks if the socket is connected to a blacklisted IP address. If the IP is blacklisted,
    the socket is closed immediately. Otherwise, a thread is started and the <span class="code">clientSocket</span> is
    passed to the <span class="code">readMessageAndRespond()</span> method for processing. The appropriate counters are
    incremented in both cases.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_26.png" alt="RN_476 code 26" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 180px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">readMessageAndRespond()</span> method processes the <span class="code">clientSocket</span>.
    It reads the request message from the socket's input stream, produces a response, and writes that response to the
    socket's output stream. At the end of the method, the socket is closed.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_27.png" alt="RN_476 code 27" class="code-image" style="width: 360px; max-height: 230px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">MeshListener.response()</span>, the call to
    <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.registerVote()</span> was changed to match the changes in that method. This
    allows additional fields from the message to be temporarily stored on the <span class="code">BlockVote</span>
    objects to facilitate later production of the <span class="code">BlockWithVotesResponse</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_28.png" alt="RN_476 code 28" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 60px;">

<p>
    The call to <span class="code">NodeManager.updateNode()</span> was removed from the condition for
    <span class="code">MessageType.BootstrapRequestV2_35</span>. This message type is no longer processed by that
    method. A condition was added to produce a <span class="code">BlockWithVotesResponse</span> for
    <span class="code">MessageType.BlockWithVotesRequest37</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_29.png" alt="RN_476 code 29" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    In response to <span class="code">BlacklistStatusRequest416</span>, a
    <span class="code">BlacklistStatusResponse</span> is now produced. This allows the operator of a verifier to monitor
    the blacklist to ensure it is not causing communication problems.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_30.png" alt="RN_476 code 30" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    Accessors were added for <span class="code">numberOfMessagesRejected</span> and
    <span class="code">numberOfMessagesAccepted</span>. These are used by
    <span class="code">BlacklistStatusResponse</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_31.png" alt="RN_476 code 31" class="code-image" style="width: 240px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message</span>, the <span class="code">whitelist</span> set was added. This is used for IP
    addresses that are exempt from the blacklist. The <span class="code">disallowedNonCycleTypes</span> set contains
    messages that are not allowed to be sent from verifiers not in the cycle.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_32.png" alt="RN_476 code 32" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">fullMeshMessageTypes</span> set are messages for which out-of-cycle verifiers are also
    potential data sources for random-node fetches.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">static</span> block of <span class="code">Message</span>, the whitelist is loaded.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_33.png" alt="RN_476 code 33" class="code-image" style="width: 460px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message.broadcast()</span>, the
    <span class="code">BlockManager.verifiersInCurrentAndNearCycleSet()</span> method is now used. This does not change
    behavior. Previously, this method assembled its own set of verifiers in and near the current cycle.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_34.png" alt="RN_476 code 34" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 150px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message.fetchFromRandomNode()</span>, the <span class="code">fullMeshMessageTypes</span> are
    now considered when selecting a random node. Full-mesh message types can be fetch from any node, while other types
    must be fetched from in-cycle nodes.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_35.png" alt="RN_476 code 35" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 140px;">

<p>
    Logging statements were added to communicate the node to which the request is made or if a node could not be found.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_36.png" alt="RN_476 code 36" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">Message.fetch()</span> method now filters outgoing messages to avoid sending messages that
    would result in blacklisting.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_37.png" alt="RN_476 code 37" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message.fromBytes()</span>, out-of-cycle verifiers sending disallowed message types are added
    to the blacklist. The blacklist improves efficiency of message rejection. The first message must be read to
    determine the verifier identifier. After the IP address is added to the blacklist, the socket can be closed before
    reading the message.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_38.png" alt="RN_476 code 38" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 130px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message.processContent()</span>, deserialization was added for
    <span class="code">BlockWithVotesRequest37</span>, <span class="code">BlockWithVotesResponse38</span>, and
    <span class="code">BlacklistStatusResponse417</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_39.png" alt="RN_476 code 39" class="code-image" style="width: 300px; max-height: 150px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">Message.loadWhitelist()</span> loads a list of IP addresses from
    <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/whitelist</span>. These addresses are exempt from the blacklist.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_40.png" alt="RN_476 code 40" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 250px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">MessageQueue</span>, the <span class="code">inBadState</span> field was removed. This field
    was used to debug stalls of the <span class="code">MessageQueue</span>, and it is no longer needed.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_41.png" alt="RN_476 code 41" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 340px;">

<p>
    The sleep in the <span class="code">MessageQueue.blockThisThreadUntilClear()</span> loop was reduced from 0.5s to
    0.1s. This allows the method to complete faster on average. Also, a 0.05s sleep was added after the loop to give the
    last message in the queue additional time to complete processing.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_42.png" alt="RN_476 code 42" class="code-image" style="width: 320px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">MessageQueue.add()</span> and <span class="code">MessageQueue.next()</span>, logging of
    <span class="code">inBadState</span> was removed.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_43.png" alt="RN_476 code 43" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 180px;">

<p>
    In the main <span class="code">MessageQueue</span> loop, the print statement for
    <span class="code">inBadState</span> was removed, and printing of the exception was eliminated. Setting of the
    <span class="code">MessageQueue.lastMessageStatus</span> field was added. In the event of future problems with the
    <span class="code">MessageQueue</span>, this field can be used to determine what may have caused a stall.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_44.png" alt="RN_476 code 44" class="code-image" style="width: 390px; max-height: 280px;">
