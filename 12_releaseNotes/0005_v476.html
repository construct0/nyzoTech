<h1>Nyzo 476: mesh reopening 2</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 476
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/35cb5510686bdc408f0bce82c461e6f6346ff5b3"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) is the second of two updates to allow the mesh to be reopened for new
    verifiers.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">BlacklistManager</span> was added to protect in-cycle verifiers from excess network traffic.
    The <span class="code">blacklistDuration</span>, the time for which an IP address typically remains in the blacklist
    after a violation, is 10 minutes. The <span class="code">useIpTables</span> argument can be changed by an individual
    operator if they do not want the verifier to use the system firewall to restrict connections.
</p>

<p>
    In the static block, all <span class="code">iptables</span> rules are flushed to avoid problems with lingering rules
    that may have been set by a previous instance of the verifier.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistManager.addToBlacklist()</span> adds a single IP address to the blacklist map. The
    address is only added when the <span class="code">BlockManager</span> is initialized and has a complete cycle,
    because erroneous identification of verifiers as being out-of-cycle might happen otherwise.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_1.png" alt="RN_476 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 310px; max-height: 110px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistManager.inBlacklist()</span> is used to enforce the blacklist.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_2.png" alt="RN_476 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 50px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistManager.getBlacklistSize()</span> is used by
    <span class="code">BlacklistStatusResponse</span> to provide information to the verifier operator.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_3.png" alt="RN_476 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 180px; max-height: 50px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistManager.performMaintenance()</span> removes in-cycle node addresses from the blacklist.
    The allows the blacklist to mitigate attacks or inadvertent bursts from in-cycle verifiers without causing long-term
    mesh connectivity issues.
</p>

<p>
    This method also removes expired nodes from the blacklist to control memory usage.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_4.png" alt="RN_476 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 200px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistManager.setIpTableEntry()</span> runs the <span class="code">iptables</span> command to
    add or remove a firewall entry. The entry, when active, drops TCP packets from the specified source address to the
    <span class="code">MeshListener</span> port.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_5.png" alt="RN_476 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 70px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistManager.runProcess()</span> is a helper method used by the
    <span class="code">setIpTableEntry()</span> method. <span class="code">BlacklistManager.readStream()</span> is a
    helper method used to read the input and error streams of the process in the <span class="code">runProcess()</span>
    method.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_6.png" alt="RN_476 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 340px; max-height: 310px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">Block.chainScore()</span> method, the base offset for a new verifier was changed from
    <span class="code">-6</span> to <span class="code">-2</span>. This gives only the top new verifier a score lower
    than the next in-cycle verifier, where previously the top two new verifiers were assigned scores lower than the next
    in-cycle verifier.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_7.png" alt="RN_476 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 180px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager</span>, the <span class="code">currentAndNearCycleSet</span> was added so that
    top-voted verifiers could be treated similarly to in-cycle verifiers for messaging purposes.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_8.png" alt="RN_476 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 320px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    Synchronization was removed from the <span class="code">BlockManager.verifiersInCurrentCycleList()</span> and
    <span class="code">BlockManager.verifiersInCurrentCycleSet()</span> methods to improve efficiency.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_9.png" alt="RN_476 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 320px; max-height: 110px;">

<p>
    Synchronization was removed from the <span class="code">BlockManager.verifierInCurrentCycle()</span> method, and the
    <span class="code">BlockManager.verifiersInCurrentAndNearCycleSet()</span> method was added. The diff's ordering of
    changes is mildly deceptive.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_10.png" alt="RN_476 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 340px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">BlockManager.verifierInOrNearCurrentCycle()</span> method provides lookup from the
    <span class="code">currentAndNearCycleSet</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_11.png" alt="RN_476 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 320px; max-height: 60px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager.updateVerifiersInCurrentCycle()</span>, the
    <span class="code">currentAndNearCycleSet</span> is populated with the contents of the
    <span class="code">currentCycleList</span> and <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteManager.topVerifiers()</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_12.png" alt="RN_476 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 130px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockVoteManager</span>, the <span class="code">minimumVoteInterval</span> was increased from
    2.0 seconds to 5.0 seconds to improve stability of the voting process. The <span class="code">flipVoteMap</span>
    was added to prevent a verifier's vote from being changed unless the same changed vote was received two consecutive
    times, separated by the <span class="code">minimumVoteInterval</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_13.png" alt="RN_476 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 360px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    The full <span class="code">Message</span> object for a <span class="code">BlockVote</span> is now passed to the
    <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.registerVote()</span> method. The fields of this message are now stored on the
    vote to allow the votes to be shared later in <span class="code">BlockWithVotesResponse</span> objects.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_14.png" alt="RN_476 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    The next section of the diff is largely due to indentation changes. Setting of the
    <span class="code">receiptTimestamp</span>, with the addition of new fields, was just explained. Most of the vote
    registration code pictured here is unchanged. The new code, at lines 51 and 52, is fetching of the existing vote and
    checking whether it is <span class="code">null</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_15.png" alt="RN_476 code 15" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 440px;">

<p>
    If the <span class="code">existingVote</span> is null, the new vote is registered.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_16.png" alt="RN_476 code 16" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 230px;">

<p>
    When a verifier has changed its vote, the <span class="code">flipVoteMap</span> is now used. This is an important
    new protection to avoid one-block forks in the blockchain. Instead of accepting and registering changed votes
    immediately, the changed votes are stored in the <span class="code">flipVoteMap</span>, and a confirmation vote is
    required before the vote is updated in the primary map.

</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_17.png" alt="RN_476 code 17" class="code-image" style="width: 460px; max-height: 290px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.removeOldVotes()</span>, votes are now retained for 40 blocks behind the
    frozen edge to support the <span class="code">BlockWithVotesResponse</span>. The new
    <span class="code">flipVoteMap</span> is cleaned in this method, also.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_18.png" alt="RN_476 code 18" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 160px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.votesAtHeight()</span> was planned to be a temporary entry in the
    <span class="code">StatusResponse</span>. However, it has been more useful than anticipated, so it will be retained.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_19.png" alt="RN_476 code 19" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 40px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.numberOfVotesAtHeight()</span> provides the size of the vote map at the
    specified height. This is used in <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.updateVote()</span> to delay attempts to
    reach consensus until a suitable number of votes for the height have been tabulated.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_20.png" alt="RN_476 code 20" class="code-image" style="width: 300px; max-height: 70px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.getLocalVotes()</span> was removed. This method was previously used by
    <span class="code">NodeJoinResponse</span>, but it is no longer included in the updated, less burdensome
    initialization process.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_21.png" alt="RN_476 code 21" class="code-image" style="width: 370px; max-height: 130px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.requestMissingVotes()</span>, fallback wait times were reduced to improve the
    speed of consensus when votes have been dropped. The call to <span class="code">registerVote()</span> now passes the
    entire <span class="code">Message</span> instead of just the identifier and <span class="code">BlockVote</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_22.png" alt="RN_476 code 22" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 300px;">

<p>
    Some log statements that were no longer needed were removed from
    <span class="code">ChainInitializationManager</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_23.png" alt="RN_476 code 23" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 180px;">

<p>
    Counters were added to <span class="code">MeshListener</span> to track how many messages are accepted and rejected
    under the new message rules.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_24.png" alt="RN_476 code 24" class="code-image" style="width: 240px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    In the outer thread of <span class="code">MeshListener.start()</span>, the inline inner thread started in response
    to accepted sockets has been removed.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_25.png" alt="RN_476 code 25" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 250px;">

<p>
    The replacement code first checks if the socket is connected to a blacklisted IP address. If the IP is blacklisted,
    the socket is closed immediately. Otherwise, a thread is started and the <span class="code">clientSocket</span> is
    passed to the <span class="code">readMessageAndRespond()</span> method for processing. The appropriate counters are
    incremented in both cases.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_26.png" alt="RN_476 code 26" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 180px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">readMessageAndRespond()</span> method processes the <span class="code">clientSocket</span>.
    It reads the request message from the socket's input stream, produces a response, and writes that response to the
    socket's output stream. At the end of the method, the socket is closed.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_27.png" alt="RN_476 code 27" class="code-image" style="width: 360px; max-height: 230px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">MeshListener.response()</span>, the call to
    <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.registerVote()</span> was changed to match the changes in that method. This
    allows additional fields from the message to be temporarily stored on the <span class="code">BlockVote</span>
    objects to facilitate later production of the <span class="code">BlockWithVotesResponse</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_28.png" alt="RN_476 code 28" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 60px;">

<p>
    The call to <span class="code">NodeManager.updateNode()</span> was removed from the condition for
    <span class="code">MessageType.BootstrapRequestV2_35</span>. This message type is no longer processed by that
    method. A condition was added to produce a <span class="code">BlockWithVotesResponse</span> for
    <span class="code">MessageType.BlockWithVotesRequest37</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_29.png" alt="RN_476 code 29" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    In response to <span class="code">BlacklistStatusRequest416</span>, a
    <span class="code">BlacklistStatusResponse</span> is now produced. This allows the operator of a verifier to monitor
    the blacklist to ensure it is not causing communication problems.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_30.png" alt="RN_476 code 30" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    Accessors were added for <span class="code">numberOfMessagesRejected</span> and
    <span class="code">numberOfMessagesAccepted</span>. These are used by
    <span class="code">BlacklistStatusResponse</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_31.png" alt="RN_476 code 31" class="code-image" style="width: 240px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message</span>, the <span class="code">whitelist</span> set was added. This is used for IP
    addresses that are exempt from the blacklist. The <span class="code">disallowedNonCycleTypes</span> set contains
    messages that are not allowed to be sent from verifiers not in the cycle.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_32.png" alt="RN_476 code 32" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">fullMeshMessageTypes</span> set are messages for which out-of-cycle verifiers are also
    potential data sources for random-node fetches.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">static</span> block of <span class="code">Message</span>, the whitelist is loaded.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_33.png" alt="RN_476 code 33" class="code-image" style="width: 460px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message.broadcast()</span>, the
    <span class="code">BlockManager.verifiersInCurrentAndNearCycleSet()</span> method is now used. This does not change
    behavior. Previously, this method assembled its own set of verifiers in and near the current cycle.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_34.png" alt="RN_476 code 34" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 150px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message.fetchFromRandomNode()</span>, the <span class="code">fullMeshMessageTypes</span> are
    now considered when selecting a random node. Full-mesh message types can be fetch from any node, while other types
    must be fetched from in-cycle nodes.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_35.png" alt="RN_476 code 35" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 140px;">

<p>
    Logging statements were added to communicate the node to which the request is made or if a node could not be found.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_36.png" alt="RN_476 code 36" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">Message.fetch()</span> method now filters outgoing messages to avoid sending messages that
    would result in blacklisting.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_37.png" alt="RN_476 code 37" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message.fromBytes()</span>, out-of-cycle verifiers sending disallowed message types are added
    to the blacklist. The blacklist improves efficiency of message rejection. The first message must be read to
    determine the verifier identifier. After the IP address is added to the blacklist, the socket can be closed before
    reading the message.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_38.png" alt="RN_476 code 38" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 130px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message.processContent()</span>, deserialization was added for
    <span class="code">BlockWithVotesRequest37</span>, <span class="code">BlockWithVotesResponse38</span>, and
    <span class="code">BlacklistStatusResponse417</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_39.png" alt="RN_476 code 39" class="code-image" style="width: 300px; max-height: 150px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">Message.loadWhitelist()</span> loads a list of IP addresses from
    <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/whitelist</span>. These addresses are exempt from the blacklist.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_40.png" alt="RN_476 code 40" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 250px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">MessageQueue</span>, the <span class="code">inBadState</span> field was removed. This field
    was used to debug stalls of the <span class="code">MessageQueue</span>, and it is no longer needed.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_41.png" alt="RN_476 code 41" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 340px;">

<p>
    The sleep in the <span class="code">MessageQueue.blockThisThreadUntilClear()</span> loop was reduced from 0.5s to
    0.1s. This allows the method to complete faster on average. Also, a 0.05s sleep was added after the loop to give the
    last message in the queue additional time to complete processing.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_42.png" alt="RN_476 code 42" class="code-image" style="width: 320px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">MessageQueue.add()</span> and <span class="code">MessageQueue.next()</span>, logging of
    <span class="code">inBadState</span> was removed.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_43.png" alt="RN_476 code 43" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 180px;">

<p>
    In the main <span class="code">MessageQueue</span> loop, the print statement for
    <span class="code">inBadState</span> was removed, and printing of the exception was eliminated. Setting of the
    <span class="code">MessageQueue.lastMessageStatus</span> field was added. In the event of future problems with the
    <span class="code">MessageQueue</span>, this field can be used to determine what may have caused a stall.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_44.png" alt="RN_476 code 44" class="code-image" style="width: 390px; max-height: 280px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlockWithVotesRequest37</span>, <span class="code">BlockWithVotesResponse38</span>,
    <span class="code">BlacklistStatusRequest416</span>, and <span class="code">BlacklistStatusResponse417</span> were
    added to <span class="code">MessageType</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_45.png" alt="RN_476 code 45" class="code-image" style="width: 200px; max-height: 180px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">NewVerifierQueueManager</span>, the
    <span class="code">consecutiveBlocksVotingForSameVerifier</span> field was added to ensure that a verifier does not
    receive a vote for too long if it is not joining the cycle.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_46.png" alt="RN_476 code 46" class="code-image" style="width: 270px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">NewVerifierQueueManager.updateVote()</span>, the vote is now registered locally even if this
    verifier is not in the cycle. A later condition is applied to avoid broadcast of votes from out-of-cycle verifiers.
    This is the condition that is true when the vote changes, so
    <span class="code">consecutiveBlocksVotingForSameVerifier</span> is reset to <span class="code">1</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_47.png" alt="RN_476 code 47" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 270px;">

<p>
    When the vote has not changed, <span class="code">consecutiveBlocksVotingForSameVerifier</span> is incremented.
    After allowing for approximately 50 blocks more than the blockchain-enforced entry interval, a selected verifier is
    demoted to give another verifier a chance to join.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_48.png" alt="RN_476 code 48" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    An accessor is provided for <span class="code">currentVote</span>. This is used by
    <span class="code">MeshStatusResponse</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_49.png" alt="RN_476 code 49" class="code-image" style="width: 210px; max-height: 40px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteManager.topVerifiers()</span>, the list of verifiers is now limited to a size
    of 3. The list is now displayed.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_50.png" alt="RN_476 code 50" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 200px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">NodeManager</span>, the new <span class="code">persistedQueueTimestamps</span> map provides
    lookup of timestamps from previous runs of the verifier. The queue timestamps are periodically written to the
    <span class="code">queueTimestampsFile</span>, and this file is loaded into the map in the class's
    <span class="code">static</span> block.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_51.png" alt="RN_476 code 51" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    When a new node is created, the <span class="code">persistedQueueTimestamps</span> map is consulted. If a favorable
    timestamp for the node is available, it is applied to the node.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_52.png" alt="RN_476 code 52" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">NodeManager.demoteIdentifier()</span> method sets the timestamps for a specified identifier
    to the current timestamp. This sends the nodes to the end of the queue.
</p>

<p>
    When the <span class="code">NodeJoinResponse</span> is received in
    <span class="code">NodeManager.sendNodeJoinMessage()</span>, the block votes from that response are no longer
    registered. These were originally included to allow a new verifier to quickly become aware of the state of
    consensus, but they were unhelpful and a waste of bandwidth. While the <span class="code">NodeJoinResponse</span>
    still understands the inclusion of these votes in its serialized form, they are no longer serialized, and they are
    discarded if present during deserialization.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_54.png" alt="RN_476 code 54" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 60px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">NodeManager.demoteInCycleNodes()</span> is called periodically to ensure that verifiers that drop
    from the cycle are not immediately placed at the top of the entrance queue.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_55.png" alt="RN_476 code 55" class="code-image" style="width: 340px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">NodeManager.persistQueueTimestamps()</span> writes queue timestamps to a file so that queue
    information does not reset each time a verifier restarts.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_56.png" alt="RN_476 code 56" class="code-image" style="width: 370px; max-height: 130px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">NodeManager.loadPersistedQueueTimestamps()</span> reads the timestamp file into the
    <span class="code">persistedQueueTimestamps</span> map. This map is then used to assign timestamps when nodes are
    added to the primary map.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_57.png" alt="RN_476 code 57" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 150px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.updateVote()</span>, a comment was updated to clarify that the 0.2-second
    time calculation offset was not solely accounting for network jitter.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_58.png" alt="RN_476 code 58" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    In the vote calculation of <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.updateVote()</span>, attempt for consensus is now
    delayed until votes from at least 75% of the cycle have been received. This avoids possible selection of unpreferred
    blocks based on the receipt of coherent votes from a small portion of the cycle.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_59.png" alt="RN_476 code 59" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 370px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.updateVote()</span>, the vote is now broadcast regardless of whether it
    has changed. The new consensus process relies on multiple consecutive vote messages to change a vote, and this does
    not cause a problem with excess message traffic, because votes are still spaced by
    <span class="code">BlockVoteManager.minimumVoteInterval</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_60.png" alt="RN_476 code 60" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.castVote()</span>, the entire vote message is now registered with
    <span class="code">BlockVoteManager</span> to support building of the
    <span class="code">BlockWithVotesResponse</span>. The <span class="code">Verifier.inCycle()</span> method is now
    used instead of the <span class="code">BlockManager.verifierInCurrentCycle()</span> method. This change is purely
    for succinctness and does not change behavior.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_61.png" alt="RN_476 code 61" class="code-image" style="width: 360px; max-height: 180px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.attemptToFreezeBlock()</span>, the delay and re-check before freezing a
    block was removed. This check is no longer necessary due to the vote-flip mechanism.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_62.png" alt="RN_476 code 62" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 390px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.performMaintenance()</span> method is an encapsulation of behavior
    previously in the <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.attemptToFreezeBlock()</span> method. The only new code
    in this method is setting of <span class="code">lastBlockVoteTimestamp</span> to a value of
    <span class="code">0L</span>. All other changes are indentation differences.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_63.png" alt="RN_476 code 63" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 450px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Verifier</span>, three counters were added for controlling the out-of-cycle tracking process.
    The intent of these counters is to transition all verifiers to use the new block-with-votes messages as support
    allows, falling back to legacy messages as necessary.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_64.png" alt="RN_476 code 64" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 110px;">

<p>
    The new <span class="code">Verifier.inCycle()</span> method is now used instead of the equivalent
    <span class="code">BlockManager.verifierInCurrentCycle()</span> call. Fetching of a block based on the bootstrap
    response is now logged.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_65.png" alt="RN_476 code 65" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 150px;">

<p>
    Logging was also added to indicate when verifier initialization has completed and the main loop is about to
    commence.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_66.png" alt="RN_476 code 66" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 60px;">

<p>
    An additional check, intended to avoid blacklisting, is now performed before a block is transmitted to the cycle.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_67.png" alt="RN_476 code 67" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    Requests for unfrozen blocks and for individual block votes are no longer allowed from out-of-cycle verifiers. So,
    if this verifier is not in the cycle, those requests are no longer made. Instead, requests are now made for frozen
    blocks bundled with votes. As this is a newer message that may not be widely supported, the old message that
    requests frozen blocks without votes is used as a fallback.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_68.png" alt="RN_476 code 68" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 320px;">

<p>
    Cleanup due to freezing of a block is now logged. <span class="code">BlacklistManager.performMaintenance()</span>
    and <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.performMaintenance()</span> are now included in this process.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_69.png" alt="RN_476 code 69" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 150px;">

<p>
    When a block at a height divisible by 100 is frozen, the queue timestamps are written to a file so they will persist
    between runs of the verifier. Before the file is written, in-cycle nodes are demoted so they will not be able to
    jump to the front of the queue if they are removed from the cycle.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_70.png" alt="RN_476 code 70" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">Verifier.inCycle()</span> convenience method was added to improve code readability.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_71.png" alt="RN_476 code 71" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 70px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">Verifier.requestBlockWithVotes()</span> requests blocks with bundled votes. This allows a
    verifier, in a single message, to get both the block and the votes that show the cycle accepted the block. The block
    is registered with <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager</span>. The block-vote messages are reconstructed, and
    the votes are registered with the <span class="code">BlockVoteManager</span>. Blocks will then be frozen with the
    typical mechanism.
</p>

<p>
    Successes and failures are tracked to allow this verifier to adjust usage of this method if the cycle does not yet
    have broad support. As more of the cycle adopts this version and supports the new message, usage of the less-safe
    legacy method will automatically be tapered and eventually eliminated.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_72.png" alt="RN_476 code 72" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 400px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">Verifier.requestBlockWithoutVotes()</span> falls back to the universally supported
    <span class="code">BlockRequest11</span> message. This method is less safe because it does not verify votes and
    could potentially freeze an incorrect block.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_73.png" alt="RN_476 code 73" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 330px;">

<p>
    A missing parenthesis was added to <span class="code">BlockResponse.toString()</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_74.png" alt="RN_476 code 74" class="code-image" style="width: 260px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockVote</span>, the comment for <span class="code">timestamp</span> was modified to note
    that the timestamp in the vote is redundant. Also, three fields were added for storing properties from the
    <span class="code">Message</span>. These fields are used to construct the
    <span class="code">BlockWithVotesResponse</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_75.png" alt="RN_476 code 75" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 150px;">

<p>
    Accessors and mutators were added for the new fields.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_76.png" alt="RN_476 code 76" class="code-image" style="width: 250px; max-height: 220px;">

<p>
    The new <span class="code">BlockWithVotesRequest</span> contains the <span class="code">height</span> for a request.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_77.png" alt="RN_476 code 77" class="code-image" style="width: 280px; max-height: 450px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlockWithVotesResponse</span> contains a <span class="code">Block</span> and a list of
    <span class="code">BlockVote</span> objects.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_78.png" alt="RN_476 code 78" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 390px;">

<p>
    When serializing the <span class="code">BlockWithVotesResponse</span>, the <span class="code">Block</span> is
    included first, followed by the <span class="code">BlockVote</span> list. While <span class="code">BlockVote</span>
    objects contain <span class="code">height</span> and <span class="code">blockHash</span> values, these do not need
    to be written for each individual vote, as they are all the same as the height and hash of the block.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_79.png" alt="RN_476 code 79" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 420px;">

<p>
    Deserialization in <span class="code">BlockWithVotesResponse.fromByteBuffer()</span> reassembles the block first.
    Then, the method reassembles the list of <span class="code">BlockVote</span> objects. Note that the response does
    not require a block to be included, but if a block is not included, the list of <span class="code">BlockVote</span>
    objects must be empty.
</p>

<p>
    An overload of <span class="code">toString()</span> is provided for convenience.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_80.png" alt="RN_476 code 80" class="code-image" style="width: 380px; max-height: 370px;">

<p>
    The list of <span class="code">blockVotes</span> was removed from <span class="code">NodeJoinResponse</span>. These
    votes were unhelpful and a waste of bandwidth.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_81.png" alt="RN_476 code 81" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 440px;">

<p>
    To maintain compatibility, the serialized version of <span class="code">NodeJoinResponse</span> is still aware of
    the possible presence of the list of block votes. However, an empty list is always serialized, and any votes present
    in a serialized version are discarded.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_82.png" alt="RN_476 code 82" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 400px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">PingResponse</span> now uses the <span class="code">Message.putString()</span> and
    <span class="code">Message.getString()</span> convenience methods. This does not change behavior.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_83.png" alt="RN_476 code 83" class="code-image" style="width: 310px; max-height: 350px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistStatusResponse</span> is a <span class="code">MultilineTextResponse</span> that reports
    the count of messages rejected due to the blacklist, count of messages accepted, and blacklist size.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_84.png" alt="RN_476 code 84" class="code-image" style="width: 370px; max-height: 400px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistStatusResponse</span> is serialized with a 16-bit list length specifier followed by the
    list of character strings.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_85.png" alt="RN_476 code 85" class="code-image" style="width: 300px; max-height: 330px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlacklistStatusResponse.toString()</span> displays the number of lines in the response.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_86.png" alt="RN_476 code 86" class="code-image" style="width: 300px; max-height: 50px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">MeshStatusResponse</span> has a new constant, <span class="code">maximumNumberOfLines</span>, to
    limit the list size.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_87.png" alt="RN_476 code 87" class="code-image" style="width: 320px; max-height: 60px;">

<p>
    The list of nodes in <span class="code">MeshStatusResponse</span> is now ordered by queue timestamp instead of
    identifier.
</p>

<img src="images/0476/rn_476_88.png" alt="RN_476 code 88" class="code-image" style="width: 320px; max-height: 110px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">TODO</span> comments describe persistence of queue timestamps and demotion of in-cycle nodes
    in <span class="code">NodeManager</span>. These features were both implemented in this version, and the
    <span class="code">TODO</span> comments were inadvertently left in the code.
