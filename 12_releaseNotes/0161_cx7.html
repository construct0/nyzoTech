<h1>Nyzo Chrome 7: automatic transaction authorization</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo Chrome extension version 7
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/chromeExtension/commit/f67bc3608f2457b4f2d327408803615946eca656"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds a flow for authorization of automatic transactions.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version adds protections that will allow automatic transactions to be used by a wider user base, and this
    version will be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. However, we will always recommend using a low-balance account for
    the Chrome extension.
</p>

<p>
    In the content script, the <span class="code-mb">tip<wbr>Configuration</span> and
    <span class="code-mb">micropay<wbr>Configuration</span> have been moved outside the
    <span class="code-mb">initialize<wbr>Extension()</span> function. This allows the configurations to be updated after
    page load. Also, the <span class="code-mb">automatic<wbr>Configuration</span> was added to allow the page to request
    authorization for automatic transactions.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_0.png" alt="CX_7 image 0" class="code-image" style="width: 170px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    The iteration style for the listener for storage changes was modified, and a condition was added to respond to
    changes in automatic transaction authorizations.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_1.png" alt="CX_7 image 1" class="code-image" style="width: 340px; max-height: 150px;">

<p>
    Authorized automatic amounts are also now sent to the page to allow it to respond appropriately when authorization
    is inadequate for proper function.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_2.png" alt="CX_7 image 2" class="code-image" style="width: 340px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    Loading of Micropay configurations from the page has been refactored to the
    <span class="code-mb">load<wbr>Configuration<wbr>From<wbr>Page()</span> function. This allows the configuration to
    be loaded both on page load and whenever the <span class="code">nyzo-configuration-changed</span> event is received.
    The message listener from lines <span class="code">51</span> through <span class="code">71</span> is not new code.
    This is in the diff due to the movement of other code.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_3.png" alt="CX_7 image 3" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 320px;">

<p>
    As noted above, the <span class="code-mb">tip<wbr>Configuration</span> and
    <span class="code-mb">micropay<wbr>Configuration</span> are now declared outside the initialization function.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_4.png" alt="CX_7 image 4" class="code-image" style="width: 370px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    The removed code from lines <span class="code">72</span> to <span class="code">89</span> has moved to starting at
    line <span class="code">51</span>, as indicated above.
</p>

<p>
    The automatic configuration is now read and stored. This configuration allows specification of a receiver, minimum
    amount, recommended amount, and display name. Configuration of both an amount and receiver makes automatic
    transactions as safe as conventional transactions. Users only send money to intended recipients, and users send no
    more than intended amounts.
</p>

<p>
    The display name, not yet used, will allow better communication to users about the purpose of the authorization.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_5.png" alt="CX_7 image 5" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 350px;">

<p>
    When sending an automatic transaction, the authorization amount for the specified receiver is now checked.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_6.png" alt="CX_7 image 6" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 130px;">

<p>
    Automatic transaction amounts are deducted from authorizations.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_7.png" alt="CX_7 image 7" class="code-image" style="width: 340px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    All automatic authorizations amounts are communicated to the page on initialization with the
    <span class="code-mb">send<wbr>Authorized<wbr>Automatic<wbr>Amounts<wbr>To<wbr>Page()</span> function. They are also
    sent to the page whenever they change. This includes both increases due to new authorizations and decreases due to
    sending of automatic transactions.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_8.png" alt="CX_7 image 8" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 210px;">

<p>
    Support of the the maximum automatic authorization parameter has been added to the
    <span class="code-mb">extension<wbr>Util</span> script.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_9.png" alt="CX_7 image 9" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 210px;">

<p>
    The extension's description has been updated to reflect the new functionality offered by automatic transactions.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_10.png" alt="CX_7 image 10" class="code-image" style="width: 350px; max-height: 200px;">

<p>
    A field has been added to the options page for maximum automatic authorization.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_11.png" alt="CX_7 image 11" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 150px;">

<p>
    The options script was modified to support the maximum automatic authorization field.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_12.png" alt="CX_7 image 12" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 420px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code-mb">validate<wbr>And<wbr>Store<wbr>Maximum<wbr>Automatic<wbr>Authorization()</span> function
    follows the same pattern as the other <span class="code-mb">validate<wbr>And<wbr>Store...()</span> functions.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_13.png" alt="CX_7 image 13" class="code-image" style="width: 390px; max-height: 130px;">

<p>
    In the popup, an inconsequential oversight in the placeholder texts of the Micropay notices was remedied.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_14.png" alt="CX_7 image 14" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 280px;">

<p>
    Also in the popup, elements were added to support automatic authorizations.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_15.png" alt="CX_7 image 15" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 130px;">

<p>
    The page notice in the popup was modified to be more inclusive of current extension functionality.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_16.png" alt="CX_7 image 16" class="code-image" style="width: 350px; max-height: 110px;">

<p>
    Some variable declarations in the popup script were modified from <span class="code">var</span> to
    <span class="code">let</span> to improve scoping. The <span class="code-mb">micropay<wbr>Buttons<wbr>Active</span>
    variable was unused, so it was removed.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_17.png" alt="CX_7 image 17" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 290px;">

<p>
    The automatic authorization section of the popup is configured when authorization information is available.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_18.png" alt="CX_7 image 18" class="code-image" style="width: 380px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    Hiding of the last divider in the popup was generalized to account for the presence of the automatic authorization
    section.
</p>

<p>
    When a valid automatic configuration is available, the page notice is hidden. The page notice is only shown when a
    page does not use Micropay at all.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_19.png" alt="CX_7 image 19" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 240px;">

<p>
    The new elements were added to the set of elements that are hidden when the extension configuration is not valid.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_20.png" alt="CX_7 image 20" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code-mb">configure<wbr>Automatic<wbr>Section()</span> function displays either a button for
    authorizing an amount or a notice displaying the currently authorized amount. This function calculates the actual
    amount to be authorized, storing that value on the button for when it is clicked. If the maximum automatic
    authorization configured in the extension options is less than the page's recommended authorization, the
    authorization amount is reduced to avoid exceeding this maximum. If the extension's maximum automatic authorization
    is less than the page's minimum authorization, an error is displayed.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_21.png" alt="CX_7 image 21" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 420px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code-mb">automaticButtonClicked()</span> function stores the authorization in local extension
    storage. This triggers the listener that notifies the page that the authorization has changed, and it makes the
    authorization available for future automatic transactions.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_22.png" alt="CX_7 image 22" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 260px;">

<p>
    The code for storing and sending Micropay transactions in the <span class="code-mb">send<wbr>Transaction()</span>
    function has been reorganized slightly. Storage has been moved outside the tab query, as it had not reason to be
    inside the tab query, and the array of tabs is now checked to avoid an error if the array is empty.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_23.png" alt="CX_7 image 23" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 230px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code-mb">resend<wbr>Transaction()</span> function, the array of tabs is also now checked to
    avoid an error.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_24.png" alt="CX_7 image 24" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 170px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code-mb">is<wbr>Valid<wbr>Automatic<wbr>Configuration()</span> function checks the configuration
    retrieved from the page. The <span class="code-mb">isValidExtensionConfiguration()</span> function now includes a
    check of the maximum automatic authorization amount.
</p>

<img src="images/cx_0007/cx7_25.png" alt="CX_7 image 25" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 190px;">

<p>
    In the style sheet, the <span class="code">public-identifier</span> class was added for display of Nyzo public
    identifier strings.
</p>
