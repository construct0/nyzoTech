<h1>Nyzo 487: mesh connectivity</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 487
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/a758238883ecda0809b1f19022809fbb02939b3d"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) ensures sufficient mesh connectivity before starting the verifier loop.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version does not affect the sentinel. It only modifies the verifier initialization process.
</p>

<p>
    In <a href="v484">version 484</a>, the process for sending node-join messages was revised to reduce peak network
    traffic. While the overall effect of this change was positive, it also resulted in some verifiers taking a long time
    to establish sufficiently dense connections for proper operation. This update ensures that the main verifier loop
    does not start until a verifier has connections to at least 75% of the mesh.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">Verifier</span> class, the process for fetching the mesh from a trusted entry point has
    been refactored into a method so it could be reused later without duplicating code.

<p>
    Just before starting of the main verifier loop, logic has been added to ensure that the mesh is densely connected.
    The node-join queue is cleared, and the
    <span class="code">NodeManager.updateActiveVerifiersAndRemoveOldNodes()</span> method is called to determine to how
    many in-cycle verifiers this verifier is currently connected. As long as this verifier is not connected to at least
    75% of in-cycle verifiers, a process queries one trusted entry point for the mesh and attempts to connect to all
    nodes in the response.
