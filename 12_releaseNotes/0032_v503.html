<h1>Nyzo 503: signature handling</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 503
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/635061426d519d51294cd67099fdccab295e9c63"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) improves handling of signatures.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects both the verifier and the sentinel, as every message in Nyzo is signed.
</p>

<p>
    A member of the community, reviewing the Nyzo code, found an issue with signature handling in the
    <span class="code">SignatureUtil</span> class. While this issue is small in terms of the number of lines of code
    affected, it introduced a number of potential stability issues and opportunities for attack due to the frequency
    of use of this code path in Nyzo.
</p>

<p>
    The fix for this issue, suggested by the same member of the community who found the problem, is a simple, drop-in
    solution that requires no structural changes in logic. It directly improves the performance of the involved code,
    and it also drastically improves overall stability of the verifier and sentinel.
</p>

<p>
    The first change in this version is a modification of the recommended instance in the README file. If you are using
    AWS, our base recommendation is now a t3.small to cope with the demands of the current cycle size. If you are
    planning to use other cloud hosting providers, we recommend asking other members of the community for advice on
    those providers, as the simple specifications listed on a provider's website are often not sufficient for
    predicting whether a particular instance will be sufficient for running a successful Nyzo verifier.

<p>
    In the <span class="code">Message</span> class, the number of connection attempts has been reduced from three to
    one for each outgoing message. In a smaller cycle, the additional attempts would slightly improve success rate of
    individual messages. In a larger cycle, the additional attempts increase network traffic and increase the
    likelihood of triggering denial-of-service protections.

<p>
    The the <span class="code">SignatureUtil</span> class, the maps for storing signatures have been changed from the
    <span class="code">Signature</span> superclass to the <span class="code">EdDSAEngine</span> subclass to improve
    readability of the changes in signature handling.
</p>

<p>
    When signing or verifying signatures, the <span class="code">signOneShot</span> and
    <span class="code">verifyOneShot</span> methods are now used. These methods, specific to the
    <span class="code">EdDSAEngine</span> subclass, eliminate the memory copies and buffer resizes of the previously
    used methods. The buffer resizes were an important potential vulnerability, as verifying a 1MB message would
    cause the signature's buffer to be expanded to accommodate 1MB of data. The buffer would not be reduced in size for
    the life of the signature object. As a large number of signatures are stored in the map to reduce the overhead of
    repeated signature creation, this can easily become a sizable memory liability.
