<h1>Nyzo 638: nickname script</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 638
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/893ce1e16779edca3d228d4c258e9e0d8aad4eae"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds the <span class="code-mb">Nickname<wbr>Script</span>.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the client.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="emphasis">If it matters, it's on the blockchain.</span> This is an important idea, but it's not easy to
    implement. Putting data on the blockchain is trivial. Making that data easily accessible in a consistent manner when
    it is needed without imposing excessive computational burden on any part of the system, and without requiring
    excessive development effort, is more complicated. With NyzoScripts, we think we will be able to move a lot more
    data to the blockchain efficiently. In parallel, we intend for development of NyzoScript functionality to allow us
    to implement interesting new applications with good user experience, like the
    <a href="/micropay/cardGameExample">card game example</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Nyzo nicknames have been a fun part of the system from its inception. However, they have been mostly ephemeral. To
    our knowledge, the only comprehensive, easily accessible accounting of nicknames is on the nyzo.co database server.
    While <a href="v567">version 567</a> added nickname storage on the blockchain, proper indexing of those nicknames
    was never built into the Nyzo codebase.
</p>

<p>
    This version adds on-chain nickname functionality that builds a nickname index with the NyzoScript mechanism. The
    <a href="https://client.nyzo.co/api/script?accountIdentifier=id__8ezA79npaBzn430Y1fset6L5bZHcXhuVsYc0_1mEd8uatj3-NAMe"
       target="_blank">API result can be seen on the client</a>, and a human-readable form of the nickname list can be
    generated on the <a href="/nyzoScripts/nicknameScript">documentation page for the nickname script</a>. Future
    releases will modify the verifier to register nicknames with this script, and the Chrome extension will be updated
    to allow those not running verifiers to register nicknames for accounts, also.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code-mb">ensure<wbr>Length()</span> method was added to <span class="code-mb">Byte<wbr>Util</span>.
    This method was added for a specific use in the nickname script, but it will frequently be useful for ensuring that
    the effects of malformed input data are minimized.

<p>
    In <span class="code-mb">Nyzo<wbr>Script<wbr>Manager.<wbr>register<wbr>Scripts()</span>, the nickname script is now
    registered under the identifier
    <span class="public-identifier">id__8ezA79npaBzn430Y1fset6L5bZHcXhuVsYc0_1mEd8uatj3-NAMe</span>.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code-mb">Graffifi<wbr>Script</span> class was moved to the new <span class="code-mb">scripts</span>
    package.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code-mb">Nickname<wbr>Script</span> registers nicknames contained in sender data. If you want to
    register your account's nickname, send a standard transaction of any amount to from your account to
    <span class="public-identifier">id__8ezA79npaBzn430Y1fset6L5bZHcXhuVsYc0_1mEd8uatj3-NAMe</span>. Put your chosen
    nickname in the sender-data field of the transaction. To change the nickname, send a new transaction with the new
    nickname.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code-mb">Nickname<wbr>Script.<wbr>bytes<wbr>For<wbr>Nickname<wbr>Map()</span> method serializes
    the nickname map. Only one byte is used to store the nickname byte length, which is never more than 32.
</p>

<img src="images/0638/rn_638_4.png" alt="RN_638 image 4" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 220px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code-mb">Nickname<wbr>Script.<wbr>nickname<wbr>Map<wbr>From<wbr>Byte<wbr>Buffer()</span> method
    performs the inverse of the previous method, deserializing the nickname map.
</p>

<img src="images/0638/rn_638_5.png" alt="RN_638 image 5" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 190px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code-mb">Nickname<wbr>Script.<wbr>read<wbr>Nickname()</span> method deserializes a nickname from
    a <span class="code-mb">Byte<wbr>Buffer</span>. This method is similar to the
    <span class="code-mb">Message.<wbr>get<wbr>String()</span> method, using a single byte instead of two bytes to
    indicate the string length.
