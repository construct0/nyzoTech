<h1>Nyzo 569: WebListener replacement</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 569
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/5910a179350d2f6562a6bc4e2bcb8087d2f4db1d"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) replaces the HTTP server used in the
    <span class="code">WebListener</span>.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects all run modes when the <span class="code">WebListener</span> is in use. Any Nyzo instance that
    has not activated the <span class="code">WebListener</span> is unaffected.
</p>

<p>
    In <a href="v527">version 527</a>, the <span class="code">WebListener</span> was introduced. In
    <a href="v529">version 529</a>, sentinel monitoring with the <span class="code">WebListener</span> was added. This
    class is also used to provide basic web functionality for all other run modes of Nyzo. However, the
    <span class="code">com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer</span> class used for the <span class="code">WebListener</span>
    was not reliable. It is a simple HTTP server that was especially vulnerable to resource exhaustion, and the Nyzo
    team's publicly accessible instances using the <span class="code">WebListener</span>
    (<a href="http://quark.nyzo.co" target="_blank">quark.nyzo.co</a>,
    <a href="http://micropay.nyzo.co" target="_blank">micropay.nyzo.co</a>,
    <a href="http://tech.nyzo.co" target="_blank">tech.nyzo.co</a>,
    <a href="http://client.nyzo.co" target="_blank">client.nyzo.co</a>) required constant monitoring and frequent
    restarts. The stability and availability of <a href="http://client.nyzo.co" target="_blank">client.nyzo.co</a> will
    be especially important as API endpoints (like
    <a href="http://client.nyzo.co/api/circulation" target="_blank">coins-in-circulation</a> and
    <a href="http://client.nyzo.co/api/transactionSearch?timestamp=1564666847588" target="_blank">transaction
        search</a>) are added and utilized.
</p>

<p>
    While there are reliable, robust web servers that would be suitable for this project, the minimal requirements of
    the Nyzo <span class="code">WebListener</span>, paired with a desire to keep the codebase as compact and free of
    dependencies as possible, led to the decision to implement a simple HTTP server on top of a Java
    <span class="code">Socket</span>. The result is a bare-bones, minimally functional implementation that is already an
    overall improvement over the previously-used <span class="code">HttpServer</span> class. The simplicity of the new
    implementation will allow for continued improvement in future versions.
</p>

<p>
    A field for the <span class="code">Endpoint</span> was added to <span class="code">EndpointRequest</span>.
</p>

<p>
    A field for the <span class="code">HttpStatusCode</span> was added to <span class="code">EndpointResponse</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0569/rn_569_1.png" alt="RN_569 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 380px; max-height: 330px">

<p>
    The <span class="code">HttpStatusCode</span> enumeration encapsulates an <span class="code">int</span> status code
    with a <span class="code">String</span> label. Only <span class="code">200</span> and <span class="code">404</span>
    are currently used.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">WebListener</span> class no longer implements the <span class="code">HttpHandler</span>
    interface. This interface was required by the <span class="code">HttpServer</span> class that is no longer used.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">startWebListenerKey</span> was changed from public to private. Changes in
    <a href="v565">version 565</a> localized usage of this key to the <span class="code">WebListener</span> class.
</p>

<p>
    Several fields relating to blacklisting and limiting of concurrent connections per IP address were added. The
    connection-limiting methods used in <span class="code">MeshListener</span> were used as a template for handling of
    connections in this class. The default of <span class="code">maximumConcurrentConnectionsForIp</span>, a value of
    <span class="code">40</span>, is double the default value of the equivalent field in
    <span class="code">MeshListener</span>. This reflects the higher concurrency required by web browsers.
</p>

<p>
    Creation of an <span class="code">HttpServer</span> object was replaced with creation of a
    <span class="code">ServerSocket</span> object. The <span class="code">HttpServer</span> handles the fundamentals of
    the HTTP protocol, while the <span class="code">ServerSocket</span> provides <span class="code">Socket</span>
    objects when connections are accepted. The <span class="code">ServerSocket</span> and
    <span class="code">Socket</span> classes are also used for Nyzo messages in the
    <span class="code">MeshListener</span>.

<p>
    The <span class="code">handle()</span> method that implemented <span class="code">HttpHandler</span> for the
    <span class="code">HttpServer</span> was replaced with the <span class="code">processSocket()</span> method. Clients
    that have exceed the maximum allowable concurrent connections are refused.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">ConnectionManager</span> is used to force-close sockets to avoid an excess of connections in
    the <span class="code">TIME_WAIT</span> state. The <span class="code">ConnectionManager</span> is explained in more
    detail in the release notes for <a href="v539">version 539</a>.

<p>
    The request is read and processed on a separate thread. The structure of this method follows the pattern used by
    <span class="code">MeshListener</span> for responding to incoming messages.
</p>

<p>
    A read timeout of 300ms is set for the socket. This may need to be adjusted if the
    <span class="code">WebListener</span> is ever required to read large requests.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">readMessageAndRespond()</span> method provides the HTTP implementation. The HTTP method,
    requested path, and query string are retrieved from the first line of the request. For
    <span class="code">POST</span> requests, the <span class="code">Content-Length</span> header is found and the
    <span class="code">POST</span> body is read.
</p>

<p>
    An <span class="code">EndpointRequest</span> object is built to represent the request, and the response is produced
    by the <span class="code">getResponse()</span> method.
</p>

<p>
    The response is written to the <span class="code">Socket</span>'s output stream following the basic requirements of
    HTTP. The socket is then force-closed by the <span class="code">ConnectionManager.slowCloseSocket()</span> method.
</p>

<img src="images/0569/rn_569_8.png" alt="RN_569 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 440px">

<p>
    The <span class="code">getResponse()</span> method finds the <span class="code">EndpointResponseProvider</span> in
    the <span class="code">endpointMap</span> and uses it to produce the <span class="code">EndpointResponse</span>. If
    an appropriate <span class="code">EndpointResponseProvider</span> is not found, a <span class="code">404</span>
    result is produced.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">readStream()</span> method was used to read a <span class="code">POST</span> body from an
    <span class="code">HttpExchange</span> object. It is no longer needed.
