<h1>Nyzo 507: in-cycle IP-to-ID mapping</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 507
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/1d7b0150bf5b36e9bf54c7b0a0aef0f7aafdd2e5"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) corrects an issue with in-cycle node identifier updates.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version modifies code used by the verifier only. The sentinel is indirectly affected, however, as updating a
    verifier will allow it to provide more accurate information to sentinels. This is a minor update, and it can be
    skipped if you find it uninteresting.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">NodeManager</span> class limits how frequently verifier identifiers can be changed for an IP.
    If frequent IP changes were allowed, a small number of IP addresses could be used to support a larger number of
    verifiers by frequently cycling IP addresses. This protection, though, was incorrectly disallowing all identifier
    changes of IP addresses assigned to in-cycle identifiers.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">NodeManager</span> class, the <span class="code">verifierChangeAllowed()</span> method
    determines whether an update of the identifier for an IP address is permitted. Previously, this method referenced
    the queue timestamp of the verifier. This has been changed to reference a new field,
    <span class="code">identifierChangeTimestamp</span>.

<p>
    This new field was necessary because the <span class="code">queueTimestamp</span> field was reset regularly on
    nodes that were in the cycle.

<p>
    In the <span class="code">Node</span> class, the new field and its getter and setter methods have been added. The
    field is set to the current timestamp in the constructor.
</p>

<p>
    When a node at an existing IP address is updated, the identifier-change timestamp is updated. This is the only
    location where this field is updated outside of the <span class="code">Node</span> constructor. So, unlike the
    <span class="code">queueTimestamp</span> field, this field will not cause an identifier to be locked to an IP
    address indefinitely.
