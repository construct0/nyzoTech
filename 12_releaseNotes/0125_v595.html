<h1>Nyzo 595: legacy node-join removal</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 595
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/75786060a822443154bcdaaa371fe8696d54a201"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) completely removes the legacy node-join messages.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects code used by the verifier, but it will not significantly affect operation. It removes a message
    that has been obsolete since version 510.
</p>

<p>
    This change is being made to remove legacy code that was a detriment to readability, especially to those who have
    not followed the evolution of Nyzo. We feel that the purported advantages of open-source software are largely absent
    when only a single group of developers actively works on a project, and we will continue to work to make the Nyzo
    code as approachable and as readable as we can to encourage more people to understand the project and contribute to
    it.
</p>

<p>
    When UDP messaging was added in <a href="v510">version 510</a>, the <span class="code">NodeJoinV2_43</span> and
    <span class="code">NodeJoinResponseV2_44</span> message types were added to accommodate the UDP port in the message.
    In <a href="v521">version 521</a>, sending of legacy node-join messages was removed from
    <span class="code">NodeManager.sendNodeJoinRequests()</span>. In <a href="v572">version 572</a>, in-kind responses
    to legacy node-join messages were eliminated.
</p>

<p>
    So, these messages have been effectively obsolete for 85 versions, and they have been entirely unused for 23
    versions. They can be safely removed.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">MeshListener</span>, the <span class="code">NodeJoin3</span> and
    <span class="code">NodeJoin4</span> types were removed from the <span class="code">disallowedUdpTypes</span> set.
    Also, processing of the <span class="code">NodeJoin3</span> type was removed from the
    <span class="code">response()</span> method that provides responses for all incoming messages.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message.processContent()</span>, the method that deserializes objects from messages,
    processing of <span class="code">NodeJoin3</span> and <span class="code">NodeJoinResponse4</span> was eliminated.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">MessageType</span> enumeration, the <span  class="code">NodeJoin3</span> and
    <span class="code">NodeJoinResponse4</span> messages were commented out. As with other legacy message types, these
    were left in place for reference.
</p>

<p>
    Note that these message type numbers can be reused in the future if necessary. The type is stored as a 2-byte
    (16-bit) integer in serialized form, which allows for 65536 possible values. However, test messages start at
    <span class="code">200</span>, leaving only the <span class="code">1-199</span> range for standard-operation
    messages. Currently, the highest-numbered message in this group is <span class="code">IpAddressResponse54</span>.

<p>
    In <span class="code">NodeManager</span>, <span class="code">NodeJoin3</span> and
    <span class="code">NodeJoinResponse4</span> are no longer handled.
