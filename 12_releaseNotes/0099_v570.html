<h1>Nyzo 570: transaction forwarding</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 570
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/5e93571e795db07d99bd24b50655d37a09289358"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds the <span class="code">TransactionForwardCommand</span> and
    <span class="code">FrozenEdgeCommand</span> to the client to allow transaction forwarding. It also improves the
    memory efficiency of data persistence in <span class="code">NodeManager</span>.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    The new commands add functionality to the client. The <span class="code">NodeManager</span> persistence improvements
    reduce the memory requirements of the verifier.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">NodeManager</span>, the <span class="code">activeIdentifiers</span> set was eliminated to
    reduce memory usage. The <span class="code">getNumberOfActiveIdentifiers()</span> method, used by the
    <span class="code">StatusResponse</span>, was replaced with the more informative and more frugal
    <span class="code">getNumberOfNodesInMap()</span> method. The unused <span class="code">isActive()</span> method
    was removed.
</p>

<p>
    Building of the <span class="code">activeIdentifiers</span> set was removed from
    <span class="code">NodeManager.updateActiveVerifiersAndRemoveOldNodes()</span>.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">NodeManager.persistNodes()</span> was rewritten to use less memory. Instead of building the file
    contents as a list of strings and writing the list to a file, a <span class="code">BufferedWriter</span> is used.
    The file is written to a temporary location and moved atomically to the final location to avoid potential data loss
    if the verifier program is terminated mid-write.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">NodeManager.loadPersistedNodes()</span> was changed similarly. Instead of reading the entire file
    into memory and iterating over the lines of the file, a <span class="code">BufferedReader</span> is now used, and
    the lines are processed as they are read.
</p>

<img src="images/0570/rn_570_3.png" alt="RN_570 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 250px">

<p>
    <span class="code">ClientTransactionUtil.sendTransactionToLikelyBlockVerifiers()</span> now returns an array of
    <span class="code">ByteBuffer</span> objects. This array is always of size 3, and it contains
    <span class="code">null</span> if the information for one of the positions is missing. The middle position of the
    array contains the identifier of the verifier that is expected to verify the block containing the transaction. The
    other two positions contain the verifier before and after this verifier in the cycle. Sending a transaction to all
    3 of these verifiers allows the transaction to be processed even if a verifier is added or removed from the cycle
    between the time the transaction is sent and the time the block is processed.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">FrozenEdgeCommand</span> and <span class="code">TransactionForwardCommand</span> were added to
    <span class="code">CommandManager</span>.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">CommandTable</span>, the <span class="code">rows</span> field was changed from an array of
    type <span class="code">String</span> to an array of type <span class="code">Object</span>. This allows numerical
    and boolean values to be represented properly in JSON.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">ConsoleUtil</span>, two changes were made to accommodate the new data type of the
    <span class="code">row</span> field in <span class="code">CommandTable</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0570/rn_570_7.png" alt="RN_570 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 340px; max-height: 280px">

<p>
    In <span class="code">SimpleExecutionResult</span>, some changes were made to accommodate the new data type of rows
    in <span class="code">CommandTable</span> objects. Also, a missing call to
    <span class="code">WebUtil.sanitizeString()</span> was added.
</p>

<img src="images/0570/rn_570_8.png" alt="RN_570 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 360px; max-height: 320px">

<p>
    In <span class="code">SimpleExecutionResult.toJson()</span>, considerations were added for
    <span class="code">Boolean</span> values and for the wider possibility of types in data cells. These changes,
    collectively with the table changes, allow boolean (<span class="code">true</span>/<span class="code">false</span>)
    and numerical values to be rendered properly in JSON responses.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">BalanceDisplayCommand</span> and <span class="code">CoinsInCirculationCommand</span>, block
    heights are no longer converted to <span class="code">String</span> objects. The does not affect their display in
    HTML responses, but it causes them to be displayed as numerical values in JSON responses.
</p>

<img src="images/0570/rn_570_10.png" alt="RN_570 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 250px">

<p>
    <span class="code">FrozenEdgeCommand</span> implements the methods required by the <span class="code">Command</span>
    interface. It requires no arguments, nor does it require validation or confirmation. It is not long-running.
</p>

<img src="images/0570/rn_570_11.png" alt="RN_570 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 340px; max-height: 420px">

<p>
    <span class="code">FrozenEdgeCommand</span> provides the height, hash, verification timestamp in milliseconds, and

<p>
    In <span class="code">NttpDataGenerateCommand</span>, the NTTP number is no longer concatenated with an empty string
    for the result table. This does not change the result, because this field had already been changed to a
    <span class="code">String</span> when support for compound NTTP numbers was added in <a href="v566">version 566</a>.
</p>

<img src="images/0570/rn_570_13.png" alt="RN_570 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 350px; max-height: 110px">

<p>
    The new <span class="code">TransactionForwardCommand</span> accepts a Nyzo string of a transaction and forwards it
    to the appropriate verifiers in the cycle. The transaction is the only argument. The command requires validation,
    but it does not require confirmation. It is not long-running.
</p>

<img src="images/0570/rn_570_14.png" alt="RN_570 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 250px; max-height: 380px">

<p>
    The <span class="code">validate()</span> method of <span class="code">TransactionForwardCommand</span> only checks
    to ensure that the argument provided represents a valid <span class="code">NyzoStringTransaction</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0570/rn_570_15.png" alt="RN_570 code 15" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 290px">

<p>
    The <span class="code">run()</span> method of <span class="code">TransactionForwardCommand</span> first builds the
    headers for the <span class="code">CommandTable</span>. The IDs of the transaction sender and receiver, along with
    the IDs of the expected verifier and the verifiers before and after in the cycle, are provided in both raw format
    and in Nyzo string format. The transaction amount is also provided, as is a value indicating whether the transaction
    was actually forwarded to the cycle verifiers.
</p>

<img src="images/0570/rn_570_16.png" alt="RN_570 code 16" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 180px">

<p>
    The transaction is retrieved from the arguments and initial validation is performed. Warnings and errors from the
    validation process are provided in the response. If the transaction passes initial validation, it is forwarded to
    the 3 verifiers in the cycle most likely to approve it.
</p>

<p>
    A row containing the result data is added to the table, and the result is returned as a
    <span class="code">SimpleExecutionResult</span>.

<p>
    <span class="code">TransactionSearchCommand</span> now includes an option to search by Nyzo string.

<p>
    The transaction string is now used when provided. It is used to set the timestamp for search.

<img src="images/0570/rn_570_20.png" alt="RN_570 code 20" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 210px">

<p>
    The transaction string is now provided as an output for all transactions, regardless of the search method used.
    While timestamp is used as the primary search criterion when the transaction string is provided, further filtering
    is applied to ensure that only the precise transaction represented by the transaction string is returned in the
    search results.
</p>

<img src="images/0570/rn_570_21.png" alt="RN_570 code 21" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 270px">

<p>
    Each transaction is encoded as a Nyzo string for display in the result table. Numerical values are no longer
    converted to <span class="code">String</span> objects, taking advantage of the new ability of
    <span class="code">CommandTable</span> to properly handle non-<span class="code">String</span> values. Two
    unnecessary concatenations with the empty string were also removed.
</p>

<img src="images/0570/rn_570_22.png" alt="RN_570 code 22" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 160px">

<p>
    In <span class="code">StatusResponse</span>, the replacement
    <span class="code">NodeManager.getNumberOfNodesInMap()</span> is now used instead of
    <span class="code">NodeManager.getNumberOfActiveIdentifiers()</span>. This is a change in meaning: the new value is
    the number of IP addresses tracked by the <span class="code">NodeManager</span>, while the old value was the number
    of unique identifiers present in the map.
</p>

<p>
    This new value, while eliminating some computational overhead, is also a more useful value to observe. For in-cycle
    verifiers, knowing the active identifiers is important, because it prevents multiple verifier instances for a single
    identifier from masking connectedness issues within the cycle. However, connectedness of the overall mesh, when
    out-of-cycle verifiers are included, is not a concern.
