<h1>Nyzo 486: cycle limit</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 486
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/d216af843de34efc7ef1ccd816b5c7dd046514f6"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) removes the cycle limit from the verifier.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version does not affect either the sentinel or the verifier in a significant way. It only removes dormant
    verifier functionality to eliminate concerns about centralization.
</p>

<p>
    The rate at which verifiers can be added to the cycle is inversely proportional to the cycle length. When Nyzo was
    first released, we were unsure how the cycle would behave as the cycle length increased. To allow some control over
    the growth of the cycle, the (incorrectly named) mesh limit was introduced. While this functionality has been
    clearly and decisively unused for over a month, and could be disabled easily on individual verifiers from day 1, it
    is now being removed entirely to eliminate potential concerns about centralization.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteManager</span> class, the <span class="code">meshLimit</span> variable was
    removed. A more appropriate name for this variable would have been <span class="code">cycleLimit</span>.

<p>
    Also in this class, the method that fetched the limit from the Nyzo web server was removed.

<p>
    In the <span class="code">topVerifiers()</span> method of the same class, the condition that considered the limit
    was removed. Exceeding the limit would cause the list of top new verifiers to be empty, which would prevent
    acceptance of blocks produced by new verifiers in most cases.

<p>
    In the <span class="code">Verifier</span> class, calls to update the limit were removed.
