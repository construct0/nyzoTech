<h1>Nyzo 598: cycle digest serialization</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 598
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/55fd667bf828296d5214dff79787535d19b2d78b"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds serialization and deserialization of the
    <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> class.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version does not yet affect any run modes.
</p>

<p>
    In <a href="v596">version 596</a>, the <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> was introduced. While this class will
    be useful locally, it will also be useful for transmission to other systems to aid in initialization. This version
    adds serialization and deserialization of <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> objects. It also adds, to the
    <span class="code">CycleDigestTest</span> class, verification of the serialization and deserialization processes.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> class now implements the <span class="code">MessageObject</span>
    interface.

<p>
    In <span class="code">CycleDigest</span>, the <span class="code">numberOfUniqueIdentifiers</span> field was added.
    This value is needed by the <span class="code">getByteSize()</span> method, and it is expensive to calculate.
</p>

<p>
    The constructor for <span class="code">CycleDigest</span> no longer accepts a
    <span class="code">cycleStartIndices</span> argument. These are now derived in the constructor. Also, the new
    <span class="code">numberOfUniqueIdentifiers</span> field is calculated, and the
    <span class="code">identifiers</span> list is appropriately trimmed. These changes were made to reduce code
    duplication with the new <span class="code">fromByteBuffer()</span> method.
</p>

<p>
    Calculation of <span class="code">cycleStartIndices</span> in
    <span class="code">CycleDigest.digestForNextBlock()</span> was moved to a separate method.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">getByteSize()</span> method is required by the <span class="code">MessageObject</span>
    interface. The comments explain how the object is serialized. This representation reduces typical serialized size
    by about 74% relative to a naive implementation that serializes the full identifier list directly.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">CycleDigest.getBytes()</span> method is an obvious implementation to anyone who reads and
    understands the comment in <span class="code">getByteSize()</span>. This method, which serializes the object, is
    required by the <span class="code">MessageObject</span> interface.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">CycleDigest.fromByteBuffer()</span> method deserializes the object. It is a
    <span class="code">static</span> (class, not instance) method, so it is not a part of the
    <span class="code">MessageObject</span> interface. However, this method is, by convention, implemented by all
    classes that implement the <span class="code">MessageObject</span> interface.
</p>

<p>
    To facilitate comparisons in <span class="code">CycleDigestTest</span>, the
    <span class="code">CycleDigest.hashCode()</span> and <span class="code">CycleDigest.equals()</span> methods were
    implemented. In Java, overriding the <span class="code">hashCode()</span> method is necessary when overriding the
    <span class="code">equals()</span> method. If two objects are equal, they must have the same hash code.
</p>

<p>
    Implementation of these methods is typically uninteresting. The <span class="code">hashCode()</span> method can take
    advantage of the <span class="code">Objects.hash()</span> method, which should be provided with all pertinent
    fields from the object. The equals method handles exact-object comparisons, <span class="code">null</span> values,
    and type differences, producing a result based on comparison of all pertinent fields when the provided object is the
    correct type.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">CycleDigestTest</span> class now serializes and deserializes every
    <span class="code">CycleDigest</span>, comparing the deserialized copy to the original. If any differences are
    found, a message is printed and the test terminates.
