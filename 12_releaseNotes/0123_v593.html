<h1>Nyzo 593: new-verifier blocks</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 593
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/91c1cb5cfceeeb75789e8bb73233ab0a05fc9a9a"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds a fallback score calculation for blocks from new verifiers. This
    should prevent the stalls that occurred when attempting to add new verifiers to the cycle.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects the verifier.
</p>

<p>
    We have been planning on a full rework of the <span class="code">BlockManager</span> class. The concept of the
    cycle, and the integrity of the rules of the proof of diversity, are central to Nyzo's validity as a challenger to
    proof-of-work. The <span class="code">BlockManager</span> is responsible for maintaining information necessary to
    enforce proof-of-diversity rules, and it has done the job well. However, it is quite complicated, and this
    complication has led us to be exceptionally careful when making changes to this class.
</p>

<p>
    In <a href="v588">version 588</a>, we made a change to the initialization process of
    <span class="code">BlockManager</span>. While the code changes were small, we tested them extensively, and we
    reviewed the code repeatedly to ensure that no regressions were introduced.
</p>

<p>
    However, when stalls started to appear when attempting to add new verifiers, those stalls certainly seemed to be
    tied to the <span class="code">BlockManager</span>, leading us to be concerned that an unnoticed issue had gotten
    past our testing for version 588. Our first symptom correction, a modification of new-verifier scoring in
    <a href="v590">version 590</a>, was accurate in its location but lacking in its understanding of the root problem.
</p>

<p>
    The second symptom correction, a retention of blocks in <a href="v591">version 591</a>, was similarly close but
    incomplete. When this correction failed, a request to <a href="/quickTips/temporarilyCloseCycle">temporarily close
    the cycle to new verifiers was issued</a>. The frequent stalls were frustrating to cycle operators, and they were
    frustrating to us. We needed some time to step back and really understand the issue.
</p>

<p>
    We thank the cycle for temporarily closing entrance, and we feel that we now have a sufficiently complete
    understanding of the problem.
</p>

<p>
    The problem, as has been the case with several issues resulting in blockchain stall, was due to an incomplete
    initialization state concurrently in too many verifiers in the cycle. Similar has been seen with verifiers unable to
    score any blocks, thus unable to vote at all or produce blocks, which are depicted as orange on the cycle page.
</p>

<p>
    In this case, the verifiers were unable to score blocks only from new verifiers. An additional two cycles of history
    are required for new verifiers than are required for existing verifiers with the current scoring logic. While we
    were concerned that our version-588 changes to <span class="code">BlockManager</span> caused a regression, we found
    that versions older than 588 exhibited the same problem when tested.
</p>

<p>
    The fixes for this version have been kept to a minimum for clarity. This is not a situation where we want to make
    sweeping changes to drastically improve the system, though we do intend to make such changes soon. This is a
    situation where we want a precise, targeted fix that corrects the problem and leaves little room for doubt over
    whether the problem was properly diagnosed and resolved.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">Block.getMinimumVoteTimestamp()</span> and <span class="code">Block.chainScore()</span>, an
    argument called <span class="code">isConsensusChoice</span> was added. The default value of this argument is
    <span class="code">false</span>, and the behavior of these methods is unchanged when the value is
    <span class="code">false</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0593/rn_593_0.png" alt="RN_593 code 0" class="code-image" style="width: 370px; max-height: 250px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Block.chainScore()</span>, the <span class="code">isConsensusChoice</span> argument is used in
    the precise location, matching only the precise logic, that caused stalls before. If the continuity state cannot be
    determined, but the cycle information can be determined and the verifier is above the 50% consensus threshold, then
    a valid score (<span class="code">7</span>) is assigned.
</p>

<img src="images/0593/rn_593_1.png" alt="RN_593 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 210px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BlockManager</span>, the changes made to
    <span class="code">likelyAcceptingNewVerifiers()</span> in version 592 were reverted.
</p>

<img src="images/0593/rn_593_2.png" alt="RN_593 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 140px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">NewVerifierQueueManager</span>, fields were added for sending top-new-verifier votes
    periodically even if they are unchanged. Timed updates can be especially useful when a stall occurs, because the
    normal changes and resulting broadcasts that occur due to blockchain progression are absent. These timed updates
    can help ensure continued coherence of information among the members of the cycle even if processing is not moving
    forward.
</p>

<img src="images/0593/rn_593_3.png" alt="RN_593 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 200px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">NewVerifierQueueManager.updateVote()</span> method utilizes the new fields to conduct a
    periodic broadcast even if the vote has not changed. A broadcast is still performed immediately when the vote
    changes.
</p>

<img src="images/0593/rn_593_4.png" alt="RN_593 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 650px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">NewVerifierVoteManager</span>, the hard-coded override of version 592 was reverted.
</p>

<img src="images/0593/rn_593_5.png" alt="RN_593 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 110px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">UnfrozenBlockManager.updateVote()</span>, the <span class="code">isConsensusChoice</span>
    value is now passed to the <span class="code">getMinimumVoteTimestamp()</span> method of the leading block. Note
    that this is the only consequential change in voting logic. The <span class="code">voteCount > votingPoolSize /
    2</span> expression was encapsulated in the <span class="code">isConsensusChoice</span> variable to allow reuse and
    to improve readability. A label describing the score is now appended to the vote description.
</p>

<p>
    However, these do not voting change behavior. The only behavioral change is passing
    <span class="code">isConsensusChoice()</span> to the leading block's
    <span class="code">getMinimumVoteTimestamp()</span> method, which will result in a timestamp corresponding to a
    block score of <span class="code">7</span> in limited cases that would have otherwise resulted in an unusable
    timestamp corresponding to a block score of <span class="code">Long.MAX_VALUE - 1</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0593/rn_593_6.png" alt="RN_593 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 250px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Verifier</span>, the <span class="code">NewVerifierQueueManager.updateVote()</span> method is
    now called on a regular timed interval instead of being called when a block is frozen. This ensures that it will
    continue to be called even if blockchain processing stalls.
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, there is a new method, called once each time a block is frozen, to test scoring of a block from an
    out-of-cycle verifier.
</p>

<img src="images/0593/rn_593_7.png" alt="RN_593 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 330px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">createAndScoreNewBlock()</span> method creates a block, signs it with a dummy seed, and
    prints the score of the block.
</p>

<img src="images/0593/rn_593_8.png" alt="RN_593 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 170px;">

<p>
    If you want to activate the test method, add the following line to
    <span class="filename">/var/lib/nyzo/production/preferences</span>.
</p>

<p class="command">
    create_and_score_test_new_verifier_block=1
</p>

<p>
    If you have activated this method and restarted your verifier running the latest code, you can observe the scoring
    problem that lead to the recent stalls, and you can see how the new <span class="code">isConsensusChoice</span>
    argument corrects the problem. If you run the following command from the terminal on your verifier, you will see the
    scores for the test blocks as they are produced.
</p>

<p class="command">
    tail -f /var/log/nyzo-verifier.log | grep 'chain score for new verifier'
</p>

<p>
    The test method uses a value of <span class="code">true</span> for the <span class="code">isConsensusChoice</span>
    parameter for even-height blocks and a value of <span class="code">false</span> for odd-height blocks. When a
    verifier has just restarted, the score will alternate between <span class="code">MAX-1</span>, the value assigned to
    an unscorable block, and <span class="code">7</span>, the value assigned to a new verifier that is the consensus
    leader.
</p>

<p class="console-output">
    chain score for new verifier: MAX-1, block: [Block: v=2, height=7821937, hash=39e2...5c32, id=5ef0...c775],

    chain score for new verifier: 7, block: [Block: v=2, height=7821938, hash=4f98...e379, id=5ef0...c775],

    consensus choice=false<br>
</p>

<p>
    After two cycles, the verifier will be able to score new-verifier blocks on its own. At that point, you will see
    values alternate between <span class="code">9</span>, the value assigned to a least-preferred but scorable new
    verifier, and <span class="code">7</span>, the value assigned to a new verifier that is the consensus leader.
</p>

<p class="console-output">

    consensus choice=true<br>
</p>

<p>
    One final note: while we have tested, retested, and analyzed these changes thoroughly, recreating a test environment
    similar to the existing Nyzo cycle is exceptionally challenging. If some detail was overlooked and the blockchain
    continues to stall, rolling back to 592 or casting of invalid new-verifier votes can be used to block new-verifier
    entrances again to prevent repeated stalls.
