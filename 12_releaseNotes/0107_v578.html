<h1>Nyzo 578: error responses</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 578
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/97dfe8f0c4e44b9e8bfe9cda99f266304f0131a4"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds error responses for incoming messages that are null or have invalid
    timestamps or signatures.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    The version affects all run modes that use Nyzo messages. This is an inconsequential update that is designed to
    improve error reporting and diagnosis of communication failures.
</p>

<p>
    In <span class="code">MeshListener</span>, the effective checks on message validity are unchanged. Messages still
    only go through normal processing if they are not null, if they have valid signatures, and if they have valid
    timestamps (as before, the timestamp requirement is not enforced for timestamp requests).
</p>

<p>
    However, <span class="code">Error65534</span> responses are now produced for invalid messages. Perhaps the most
    useful of these error responses will be the response indicating an invalid timestamp.

<p>
    In <span class="code">Message</span>, replay protection (timestamp validation) is now bypassed for error responses.
    This allows error responses to be received from systems with clock differences.
