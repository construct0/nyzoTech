<h1>Nyzo 526: Micropay &amp; prefilled-data commands</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 526
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/d92627d4fe0a9425e596247afa2fd2450d57b24c"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds Micropay and prefilled-data commands to the client.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version does not affect the verifier or sentinel. It only affects the client.
</p>

<p>
    In the client loop, <span class="code">canceled</span> is checked before validation. Previously, validation output
    would display once after a command was canceled. This did not cause any problems, but it was incorrect behavior.
    Also, reloading of preferences has been added before validation. The Micropay-send command requires some preferences
    to be set, and a restart to reload those preferences would be tedious.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">ClientTransactionUtil</span> class has been added to allow multiple commands to share a
    process for creating and sending transactions. The core of this class is the code that was used to create and send
    transactions in <span class="code">TransactionSendCommand</span>.
</p>

<p>
    If an IP address and port are supplied, the transaction is sent just to that receiver. The
    <span class="code">MicropaySendCommand</span> uses this single-receiver method. Otherwise, the transaction is sent
    to the cycle. The <span class="code">TransactionSendCommand</span> and
    <span class="code">PrefilledDataSendCommand</span> use the cycle-send method.
</p>

<p>
    This class also provides a method for creating a string to display sender data. This is the same method that has
    been used on the Nyzo web server. If the sender data represents a UTF-8 string that encodes back to the original
    sender-data bytes, then the data is interpreted as a UTF-8 encoded string. Otherwise, the bytes of the sender data
    are displayed in hexadecimal format.
</p>

<p>
    A static method for building a <span class="code">ValidationResult</span> instance has been added to the
    <span class="code">ValidationResult</span> class. This method is used whenever an unexpected exception is thrown
    when performing command validation. Previously, a <span class="code">ValidationResult</span> with a null argument
    list was returned in such a case, but this was causing another exception in the client loop and resulting in the
    display of a rather unhelpful error message.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">MicropayCreateCommand</span> builds a Micropay string. A Micropay string bundles receiver
    ID, sender data, amount, receiver IP, and receiver port. The receiver IP and receiver port allow the client to send
    the transaction directly to the receiver. For small transactions, such as payment for viewing newspaper articles,
    a small amount of loss due to verifier issues is acceptable. This will allow receivers to immediately verify and
    approve transactions based on the latest available balance list, and then the receivers will have the responsibility
    of forwarding the transaction to the cycle to try to have the transaction incorporated into the blockchain.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">PrefilledDataCreateCommand</span> builds a prefilled-data string. This is simply a receiver ID
    and sender data bundled into a single Nyzo string. This string was created to address any situation where a receiver
    relies on sender data to process incoming transactions. The receiver can create a prefilled-data string with the
    appropriate sender data, give that prefilled-data string to the sender, and be assured that the sender attaches the
    appropriate data to a transaction.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">PrefilledDataSendCommand</span> works just like <span class="code">TransactionSendCommand</span>.
    However, instead of accepting a receiver ID and sender data, it accepts a prefilled-data string.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="code">TransactionSendCommand</span> has some minor changes to improve user experience.
</p>

<img src="images/0526/rn_526_8.png" alt="RN_526 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 550px;">

<p>
    The functionality of <span class="code">TransactionSendCommand</span> has been moved to
    <span class="code">ClientTransactionUtil</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0526/rn_526_9.png" alt="RN_526 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 560px;">

<p>
    The encoding table has been updated to use only "unreserved" characters as defined in RFC 3986, section 2.3. The
    upcoming Micropay system will eventually allow signed transactions to be sent to web servers in URL query strings,
    so these strings should be as URL-friendly as possible.
</p>

<p>
    For compatibility with older Nyzo strings, characters from the old encoding are mapped to their new characters.
    Also, the two alphabetic characters that are omitted from the encoding table are mapped to their look-alike
    numerals in the table.
</p>

<img src="images/0526/rn_526_10.png" alt="RN_526 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 535px;">

<p>
    The receiver port has been added to <span class="code">NyzoStringMicropay</span>. This is not backward-compatible
    with older Micropay strings, but this is not a concern, as these strings are not yet widely used.
</p>

<img src="images/0526/rn_526_11.png" alt="RN_526 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 540px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">NyzoStringTest</span> has been updated to test prefilled-data strings and to include the
    receiver port in Micropay strings.
</p>

<img src="images/0526/rn_526_12.png" alt="RN_526 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 558px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">PreferencesUtil</span> was modified to allow the "=" character in values. This is no longer
    necessary functionality, as this character was removed from the Nyzo string encoding table, but the change was
    allowed to remain because it is more sensible than the previous behavior.
</p>

<img src="images/0526/rn_526_13.png" alt="RN_526 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 489px;">

<p>
    Reloading of preferences is now allowed. The client uses this functionality to ease configuration of commands that
    use preferences. Also, a method has been added for getting a <span class="code">double</span> value from
    preferences. This is currently used to retrieve the maximum Micropay amount.
