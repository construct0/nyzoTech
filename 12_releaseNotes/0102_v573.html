<h1>Nyzo 573: blockchain v2</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 573
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/9ab319d4a724faa73a48201e63a3da7d6897b78b"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) adds cycle-transaction functionality for blockchain version 2.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version affects all run modes.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">ApprovedCycleTransaction</span> class, as the comment explains, encapsulates a reduced record
    of approved cycle transactions. This is stored in the balance list to allow implementation of NTTP-3/3.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_0.png" alt="RN_573 code 0" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 560px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BalanceList</span> has two new fields. The <span class="code">pendingCycleTransactions</span> map
    allows cycle transactions to accumulate votes on the blockchain, and the
    <span class="code">recentlyApprovedCycleTransactions</span> list assists in implementation of the 10,000-block
    cumulative cycle transaction limit of &cap;100,000.
</p>

<p>
    Before blockchain version 2, these fields are both empty.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_1.png" alt="RN_573 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 250px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">BalanceList.getPreviousVerifiers()</span> accessor, a new list is no longer created. While
    creating copies of mutable fields is good object-oriented practice, it can be inefficient. Instead, to only create
    copies when necessary, the responsibility for creating a copy is typically shifted to the client of the class in the
    Nyzo codebase. This allows the client to create a copy only when mutating the object.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_2.png" alt="RN_573 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 220px; max-height: 50px;">

<p>
    Accessors for the new <span class="code">BalanceList</span> fields were added.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_3.png" alt="RN_573 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BalanceList.fromByteBuffer()</span>, the new fields are read for blockchain versions 2 and
    above.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_4.png" alt="RN_573 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 270px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BalanceList.getByteSize()</span>, the new fields are considered.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_5.png" alt="RN_573 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 260px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BalanceList.getBytes()</span>, the new fields are added. To ensure a consistent binary
    representation, the pending transactions are sorted on identifier.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_6.png" alt="RN_573 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 160px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BalanceManager.approvedTransactionForBlock()</span>, a condition was added to accept
    cycle-signature transactions in blockchain version 2 and above. These transactions allow cycle-transaction
    signatures to be placed on the blockchain immediately, eliminating the need to bundle the signatures with the
    transactions.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_7.png" alt="RN_573 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    Later in <span class="code">BalanceManager.approvedTransactionForBlock()</span>, an exception to the &micro;1
    minimum was added for cycle-signature transactions. These transactions do not even have amounts specified. In
    memory, though, the <span class="code">amount</span> field is always <span class="code">0</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_8.png" alt="RN_573 code 8" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 80px;">

<p>
    When sorting transactions to limit block size in
    <span class="code">BalanceManager.approvedTransactionForBlock()</span>, cycle-signature transactions are promoted to
    the top of the list. Without this modification, these transactions would have been placed at the bottom of the list
    and at risk of removal from large blocks.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_9.png" alt="RN_573 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 140px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">BalanceManager.enforceCycleTransactionRules()</span>, a condition was added to remove all
    cycle transactions from out-of-cycle verifiers. Also, conditions were added to ensure that cycle-signature
    transactions are only accepted from in-cycle verifiers and in the appropriate blockchain versions. These rules are
    partially or fully redundant with other transaction protections, but having them in this method improves the
    verifiability and robustness of the code.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_10.png" alt="RN_573 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 380px;">

<p>
    Later in <span class="code">BalanceManager.enforceCycleTransactionRules()</span>, a condition was added to only
    apply the old cycle-transaction rules to blockchain version 1. Cycle transactions are processed differently in
    blockchain version 2. This code is unchanged aside from the added condition and resulting indentation changes.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_11.png" alt="RN_573 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 460px; max-height: 430px;">

<p>
    Git's unfortunate handling of indentation changes continues. This code is also unchanged.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_12.png" alt="RN_573 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 460px; max-height: 430px;">

<p>
    Bundling of cycle-transaction signatures is neither required nor permitted past blockchain version 1.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_13.png" alt="RN_573 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 140px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">Block</span> class is responsible for deriving balance lists from one block to the next. At
    the top of this class, constants were added for handling the new &cap;100,000 limit on cycle account transfers every
    10,000 blocks.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_14.png" alt="RN_573 code 14" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 40px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">maximumBlockchainVersion</span> increased from <span class="code">1</span> to
    <span class="code">2</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_15.png" alt="RN_573 code 15" class="code-image" style="width: 250px; max-height: 40px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Block.fromByteBuffer()</span>, the call to
    <span class="code">Transaction.fromByteBuffer()</span> now has another argument. This argument is used to let the
    <span class="code">Transaction.fromByteBuffer()</span> method know that it is reading a transaction from a balance
    list.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_16.png" alt="RN_573 code 16" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 150px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Block.balanceListForNextBlock()</span>, the <span class="code">pendingCycleTransactions</span>
    map and <span class="code">recentlyApprovedCycleTransactions</span> list are retrieved from the previous balance
    list. When <span class="code">previousBlock</span> is <span class="code">null</span>, for the Genesis block, these
    are initialized as empty.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_17.png" alt="RN_573 code 17" class="code-image" style="width: 460px; max-height: 340px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Block.balanceListForNextBlock()</span>, in the loop that updates balances for transactions,
    cycle transactions are only processed for blockchain version 1. In blockchain version 2, cycle transactions are
    accepted into the blockchain immediately, but they only result in funds transfer if they are approved by the cycle.
    This is a single condition added, but it appears to be larger due to indentation changes.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_18.png" alt="RN_573 code 18" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 390px;">

<p>
    After the block of code that processes version 1 cycle transactions, processing of version 2 cycle transactions has
    been added. The logic was placed in a separate method to avoid making the already lengthy
    <span class="code">Block.balanceListForNextBlock()</span> method even longer.
</p>

<p>
    The new <span class="code">pendingCycleTransactions</span> and
    <span class="code">recentlyApprovedCycleTransactions</span> fields are passed to the
    <span class="code">BalanceList</span> constructor.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_19.png" alt="RN_573 code 19" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 190px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">Block.processV2CycleTransactions()</span> starts by updating the
    <span class="code">pendingCycleTransactions</span> map with transactions from the new block. New cycle transactions
    are added to the map, and transactions from out-of-cycle verifiers are removed. Cycle-signature transactions are
    attached to the appropriate cycle transactions, and out-of-cycle signatures are removed.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_20.png" alt="RN_573 code 20" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 310px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">recentlyApprovedCycleTransactions</span> list is used to determine how much of the
    &cap;100,000-per-10,000-block limit has been used. Entries are added to the end of this list, so the oldest entries
    will be at the beginning of the list. Entries that are no longer relevant are removed. The
    <span class="code">while</span> loop is not actually necessary &mdash; an <span class="code">if</span> statement
    would be satisfactory because no more than one cycle transaction is processed per block &mdash; but the
    <span class="code">while</span> loop is more robust to potential future logic changes.
</p>

<p>
    Next, the recent transactions are summed to determine how much of the limit is still available. This limit, along
    with the balance of the cycle account, determine the maximum allowable cycle transaction.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_21.png" alt="RN_573 code 21" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 200px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">pendingCycleTransactions</span> map is scanned to see if any unprocessed transactions have
    been approved. To simplify logic, no more than one cycle transaction is processed per block. If a transaction has
    enough votes is a suitable amount, the number of <span class="code">yes</span> votes is counted. If the number of
    <span class="code">yes</span> votes meets or exceeds the 50% + 1 threshold, the transaction is selected for
    processing.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_22.png" alt="RN_573 code 22" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 230px;">

<p>
    When a cycle transaction is approved, it is removed from the <span class="code">pendingCycleTransactions</span> map
    and added to the <span class="code">recentlyApprovedCycleTransactions</span> list. Then, the amount of the
    transaction is deducted from the cycle account and added to the receiver's account.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_23.png" alt="RN_573 code 23" class="code-image" style="width: 420px; max-height: 210px;">

<p>
    <span class="code">BlockchainVersionManager</span> was modified to allow multiple activation heights for different
    versions. A production activation height of 7,000,000 was added for version 2, as specified in the
    <a href="/teamTechnologyProposals/nttp3#implementation">NTTP-3 implementation plan</a>.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_24.png" alt="RN_573 code 24" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 420px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">CycleTransactionManager.registerTransaction()</span>, an empty map is passed for the new
    argument when creating a copy of the transaction without signatures.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_25.png" alt="RN_573 code 25" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">Transaction</span>, the <span class="code">typeCycleSignature</span>,
    <span class="code">voteYes</span>, and <span class="code">voteNo</span> constants were added as part of the new
    transaction-based voting system. The new type of transaction allows storage of the
    <span class="code">cycleTransactionSignature</span> and a <span class="code">cycleTransactionVote</span>. As
    transactions are all timestamped, a verifier may vote multiple times for the same cycle transaction, with the newest
    vote overriding older votes.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_26.png" alt="RN_573 code 26" class="code-image" style="width: 460px; max-height: 340px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">identifierComparator</span> sorts a list of <span class="code">ByteBuffer</span>
    representations of identifiers. This was previously specified inline for sorting cycle signatures. It was made into
    a <span class="code">public</span> field to allow reuse.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_27.png" alt="RN_573 code 27" class="code-image" style="width: 380px; max-height: 190px;">

<p>
    Methods were added for adding signatures to the map for cycle transactions, removing signatures of verifiers no
    longer in the cycle, and accessing the new fields.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_28.png" alt="RN_573 code 28" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 230px;">

<p>
    A static method was added for copying cycle transactions. In derivation of balance lists, the signature maps are
    modified, so these are copied internally. The arrays are mutable but never mutated, so they are not copied.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">cycleSignatureTransactions</span> field was added to the
    <span class="code">cycleTransaction()</span> overload used for rebuilding a serialized cycle transaction.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_29.png" alt="RN_573 code 29" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 330px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">cycleTransaction()</span> overload used to create a new cycle transaction, and empty map
    is created for the <span class="code">cycleSignatureTransactions</span> field.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_30.png" alt="RN_573 code 30" class="code-image" style="width: 370px; max-height: 40px;">

<p>
    Methods were created for building cycle-signature transactions. The first overload is for a new transaction, and the
    second is for rebuilding a serialized transaction.
</p>

<p>
    In the <span class="code">getFee()</span> method, cycle-signature transactions are explicitly excluded from fees.
    This is unnecessary, because these transactions always have an amount of <span class="code">0</span>, but it helps
    to reinforce the idea that these transactions may be freely submitted by in-cycle verifiers.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_31.png" alt="RN_573 code 31" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 320px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">Transaction.getByteSize()</span> method now considers cycle transactions for the version-2
    blockchain and cycle-signature transactions.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_32.png" alt="RN_573 code 32" class="code-image" style="width: 460px; max-height: 440px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">Transaction.getBytes()</span> method now begins with handling of the special case of
    cycle-signature transactions, which have only the <span class="code">type</span> and
    <span class="code">timestamp</span> fields in common with other transaction types.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_33.png" alt="RN_573 code 33" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 150px;">

<p>
    Later in <span class="code">Transaction.getBytes()</span>, the cases for version 1 and version 2 cycle transactions
    are handled appropriately. Each cycle transaction contains values in no more than one of the two signature maps. If
    both maps are empty, the cycle transaction is compatible with both blockchain version 1 and blockchain version 2.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="code">identifierComparator</span> is now used instead of the inline comparator.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_34.png" alt="RN_573 code 34" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 450px;">

<p>
    When rebuilding a cycle transaction, the method needs to know whether to rebuild a version-1 or version-2 cycle
    signature list. Fortunately, version-1 cycle signature lists are only contained in blocks, and version-2 cycle
    signature lists are only contained in balance lists. To provide this information, a
    <span class="code">boolean</span> argument, <span class="code">balanceListCycleTransaction</span>, was added to the
    <span class="code">Transaction.fromByteBuffer()</span> method. Some reads were moved inside conditions to allow
    cycle signature transactions to be properly read, and instances of <span class="code">recipientIdentifier</span>
    were replaced with <span class="code">receiverIdentifier</span> to make the code more consistent.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_35.png" alt="RN_573 code 35" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 400px;">

<p>
    Bundled cycle signatures are read according to whether the transaction is being read from a balance list, and the
    cycle transaction is assembled.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_36.png" alt="RN_573 code 36" class="code-image" style="width: 460px; max-height: 380px;">

<p>
    Reading of and assembly of cycle signature transactions was added.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_37.png" alt="RN_573 code 37" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Transaction.performInitialValidation()</span>, considerations were added for cycle-signature
    transactions.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_38.png" alt="RN_573 code 38" class="code-image" style="width: 460px; max-height: 340px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">Transaction.signatureIsValid()</span>, consideration was added for cycle-signature
    transactions.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_39.png" alt="RN_573 code 39" class="code-image" style="width: 410px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    In the <span class="code">TransactionResponse</span> constructor, cycle and cycle-signature transactions are added
    to the transaction pool for blockchain versions 2 and above.
</p>

<img src="images/0573/rn_573_40.png" alt="RN_573 code 40" class="code-image" style="width: 380px; max-height: 110px;">
