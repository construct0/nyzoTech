<h1>Nyzo 601: global connection limit</h1>

<p>
    Nyzo version 601
    (<a href="https://github.com/n-y-z-o/nyzoVerifier/commit/d52a530e6974cecc276df3991d6616a23e56f2c3"
        target="_blank">commit on GitHub</a>) provides a configurable global maximum on concurrent connections in
    <span class="code">MeshListener</span>. It also provides a per-IP taper to improve distribution of resources when
    connection load is high.
</p>

<p class="emphasis">
    This version only affects the verifier. This is the only run mode that uses <span class="code">MeshListener</span>.
</p>

<p>
    The changes in this version are due to a bug report by a member of the community. This member provided the following
    address for receiving a bounty:
</p>

<ul>
    <li class="code">id__8duga.00nTqUTgoHHpo6QK5qDmEWYUG0qYnDY7JEx5e11mG9qESw</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In <span class="code">MeshListener</span>, the <span class="code">maximumConcurrentConnectionsForIp</span> constant
    was renamed to <span class="code">maximumConcurrentConnectionsPerIpAbsolute</span>. The misspelling of this
    parameter in the preferences file was corrected, and the default value changed to <span class="code">5</span>. The
    higher default value of this constant, intended to avoid blacklisting of a sentinel in exceptional cases, is no
    longer necessary due to automatic whitelisting now performed by the sentinel.
</p>

<p>
    The comment explains the roles of the other new constants. In addition to a global cap on concurrent connections,
    there is also a taper on the per-IP cap to improve resource distribution. It would make no sense to reject a single
    connection from one verifier while allowing multiple connections from another verifier.
</p>

<p>
    As the comment notes, whitelisted verifiers are not subject to any connection limitations, but they do count toward
    the number of active connections.

<p>
    Some <span class="code">static</span> fields were added for storing information about the operation of the
    <span class="code">MeshListener</span>. Accessors were added to allow these fields to be added to the
    <span class="code">StatusResponse</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0601/rn_601_1.png" alt="RN_601 code 1" class="code-image" style="width: 350px; max-height: 140px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">mergeFunction</span> now returns <span class="code">null</span> for counts of
    <span class="code">0</span>. This allows the map to be continuously cleaned, only tracking IP addresses that have
    active connections.
</p>

<img src="images/0601/rn_601_2.png" alt="RN_601 code 2" class="code-image" style="width: 330px; max-height: 120px;">

<p>
    In <span class="code">MeshListener.processSocket()</span>, the global maximum and the dynamic maximum per IP are now
    enforced. The <span class="code">minimumConnectionThreshold</span> stores the lowest per-IP maximum to illustrate
    throttling.
</p>

<img src="images/0601/rn_601_3.png" alt="RN_601 code 3" class="code-image" style="width: 450px; max-height: 270px;">

<p>
    When <span class="code">activeReadThreads</span> is incremented, an accrued maximum is stored in
    <span class="code">maximumActiveReadThreads</span> for inclusion in <span class="code">StatusResponse</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0601/rn_601_4.png" alt="RN_601 code 4" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 70px;">

<p>
    The <span class="code">connectionsPerIp</span> map no longer needs to be cleared. Values of
    <span class="code">0</span> are now continuously removed due to the updated <span class="code">mergeFunction</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0601/rn_601_5.png" alt="RN_601 code 5" class="code-image" style="width: 380px; max-height: 140px;">

<p>
    At the end of <span class="code">MeshListener.processSocket()</span>, the current size of the
    <span class="code">connectionsPerIp</span> map is stored in the <span class="code">ipMapSize</span> field for
    inclusion in the <span class="code">StatusResponse</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0601/rn_601_6.png" alt="RN_601 code 6" class="code-image" style="width: 200px; max-height: 50px;">

<p>
    Some unnecessary imports were removed from <span class="code">NewBlockMessage</span>.
</p>

<img src="images/0601/rn_601_7.png" alt="RN_601 code 7" class="code-image" style="width: 220px; max-height: 100px;">

<p>
    The new <span class="code">MeshListener</span> metrics are now included in the private version of
    <span class="code">StatusResponse</span>.
</p>

<p>
    These changes required substantial testing. This version includes one of the scripts developed for testing,
    <span class="code">MeshListenerStressScript</span>. This script takes advantage of automatic whitelisting to allow
    a single IP address to place significant strain on a verifier to cause triggering of both throttling and the
    global connection cap.
</p>

<p>
    The script requires a host name or IP address and the private key of the target verifier. The number of requests,
    which defaults to 100, may also be specified.
</p>

<img src="images/0601/rn_601_9.png" alt="RN_601 code 9" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 340px;">

<p>
    The arguments are processed, and the script exits prematurely if a valid private key is not provided.
</p>

<img src="images/0601/rn_601_10.png" alt="RN_601 code 10" class="code-image" style="width: 440px; max-height: 220px;">

<p>
    The script first whitelists itself to avoid triggering the blacklisting mechanism.
</p>

<img src="images/0601/rn_601_11.png" alt="RN_601 code 11" class="code-image" style="width: 400px; max-height: 90px;">

<p>
    The script sends concurrent requests of type <span class="code">FrozenEdgeBalanceListRequest_45</span>. This request
    type was chosen because it requires a large, computationally intensive response and because it is easy to send.
</p>

<img src="images/0601/rn_601_12.png" alt="RN_601 code 12" class="code-image" style="width: 380px; max-height: 270px;">

<p>
    The helper method <span class="code">sendWhitelistRequest()</span> negotiates the two-step automatic whitelisting
    process with the target verifier.
</p>

<img src="images/0601/rn_601_13.png" alt="RN_601 code 13" class="code-image" style="width: 430px; max-height: 420px;">

<p>
    When running this script against <span class="verifier-name">&#x26f5; Argo 746</span> with a request count of
    <span class="code">1000</span>, both throttling and global limiting were observed from other verifiers that had not
    been whitelisted. The private <span class="code">StatusResponse</span> from
    <span class="verifier-name">&#x26f5; Argo 746</span> confirmed that the <span class="code">MeshListener</span> class
    was responding as expected.
</p>

<p class="code-block">
    ...<br>
    maximum active read threads: 1092<br>
    minimum connection threshold: 1<br>
    IP map size: 5<br>
    ...
</p>

<p>
    This script is an easy way to test whether your verifier will perform well under heavy connection load. With an
    appropriate argument for request count, from a single location, you can force your verifier to maintain more active
    connections that it would maintain in normal operation.
</p>

<p>
    Of course, this script could also be used to disable your verifier. This does not enable malicious attacks, because
    the script requires the target verifier's private key. The script should, however, be used with care.
