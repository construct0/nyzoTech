<h1>Nyzo tech</h1>

<p>
    This is the repository for Nyzo technical documentation. This supersedes the white paper as a technical description
    of Nyzo. The white paper, available on the web site, should be considered a historical document.
</p>

<p>
    This was made in the form of a public git repository to allow for transparent, low-effort updating.
