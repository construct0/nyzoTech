# Nyzo tech

This is the repository for Nyzo technical documentation. This supersedes the white paper as a technical description of
Nyzo. The white paper, available on the web site, should be considered a historical document.

This was made in the form of a public git repository to allow for transparent, low-effort updating.

This repository is available for viewing at [http://tech.nyzo.co](http://tech.nyzo.co)
