<h3>Proof of diversity</h3>

<p>
    The proof-of-diversity blockchain uses analysis of verification cycles to establish the authoritative form of the
    blockchain. This is not proof-of-work, and it is not proof-of-stake. It is a totally new proof system that relies
    on diversity of participation for strength. While proof-of-diversity has its own unique concerns that must be
    addressed to ensure integrity of the blockchain, it is immune to many of the attacks and problems inherent to
    proof-of-work and proof-of-stake systems, and it is significantly more efficient.
</p>

<p>
    The basic concept of proof-of-diversity is simple. Verifiers take turns producing blocks in a circular order. Some
    simple rules ensure that verifiers are neither added to nor removed from that circular order too quickly. In order
    to produce a believable forgery of the blockchain for any meaningful amount of time, an attacker would need to
    obtain more than half of the private keys of verifiers currently working on the blockchain.
</p>

<p>
    For any block in the blockchain, the verification cycle of that block is defined as the longest list of blocks,
    ending with that block, that contains no more than one instance of each verifier. Consider the following
    blockchain, where the number is the block height and the letter is the verifier:
</p>

<p class="block-list">
    20A, 21B, 22C, 23A, 24B, 25C, 26A
</p>

<p>
    In this blockchain, the verification cycle of block 26 contains blocks 26, 25, and 24. The cycle does not contain
    block 23, because verifier A is already in the cycle at block 26. The verification cycle of block 25 contains blocks
    25, 24, and 23. The cycle does not contain block 22, because verifier C is already in the cycle at block 25.
</p>

<p>
    If a verifier is new to the chain, the same definition holds. To illustrate, we add verifier D at block 27:
</p>

<p class="block-list">
    20A, 21B, 22C, 23A, 24B, 25C, 26A, 27D
</p>

<p>
    The verification cycle of block 27 is blocks 27, 26, 25, and 24. The cycle does not contain block 23, because
    verifier A is already present at block 26.
</p>

<p>
    The previous cycle of the block is the cycle immediately before the current cycle. The previous cycle of block 27
    in this example would contain blocks 23, 22, and 21, but not block 20, as verifier A is already present in that
    cycle at block 23.
</p>

<p>
    A &ldquo;new&rdquo; verifier is defined as any verifier other than the last verifier of the previous cycle. An
    &ldquo;existing&rdquo; verifier is defined as the last verifier of the previous cycle. If an existing
    verifier misses a cycle, it will be considered a new verifier the next time it verifies a block.
</p>

<p>
    Building on these definitions, we declare two rules to secure the proof-of-diversity blockchain.
